# Political correctness overrides the intrinsic value of education

By Columbus

The main objective of setting exam questions with an open ended answer or no definite correct answer is to allow the students to express their own opinions or arguments for which scores shall be given to the rationale behind their arguments. Either support or oppose a motion is not going to have any impact or diffidence on the final results of the marks. Because the emphasis on the marking scheme is on the creativity, critical thinking, logical mind and analytical skills of the students who are to be trained to acquire those vital skills and abilities which are far more important than memorising historical facts which can be easily found online on internet with minimal learning values. Nevertheless, creativity, critical thinking, logical mind and analytical skills are pragmatic and useful in many occupations such as political and news commentators, financial analysts, accountants, corporate doctors, professors, researchers etc. Evaluate students academic performance on the basis of their memory is an obsolete or outmoded educational philosophy and theory which therefore should have been discarded or phased out long time ago. Moreover, the reason I am able to write so many articles on many different issues is because I have had an intensive training in critical thinking and analytical skills. Political sensitivity is also important as far as writing political comments is concerned.

Meanwhile, the overreaction of the Hong Kong Board of Education suggests that the Hong Kong communist government simply echoed or parroted what the CCP considered as a political correctness that must override education and everything else.   
 Such a trivial matter would have triggered or spawned such a contentious/controversial social and political upheaval or turbulence is absolutely unthinkable and inconceivable.

I expect more incidents similar to this one will happen even more frequently provided that the CCP intends to turn Hong Kong one of the China cities or speed up Hong Kong 🇭🇰 mainlandization.
