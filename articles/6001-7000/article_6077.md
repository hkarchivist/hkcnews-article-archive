# 我的周末歌單72－ Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy

I've been walkin' these streets so long   
 Singin' the same old song   
 I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway   
 Where hustle's the name of the game   
 And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain   
 There's been a load of compromisin'   
 On the road to my horizon   
 But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy   
 Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo   
 Like a rhinestone cowboy   
 Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know   
 And offers comin' over the phone

Well, I really don't mind the rain   
 And a smile can hide all the pain   
 But you're down when you're ridin' the train   
 That's takin' the long way   
 And I dream of the things I'll do   
 With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe   
 There'll be a load of compromisin'   
 On the road to my horizon   
 But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Like a rhinestone cowboy   
 Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo   
 Rhinestone cowboy   
 Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know   
 And offers comin' over the phone

Like a rhinestone cowboy   
 Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy   
 Gettin' card and letters from people I don't even know....

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
