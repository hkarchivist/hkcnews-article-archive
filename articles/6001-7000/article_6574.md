I feel enormously sad of David's passing. Selina and I offered a remembrance mass service for him at the Catholic Cathedral this evening.

He has been a great friend of mine for many years. Like many of his friends, I treasure the indelibly precious mark David has left in my life. He was generous, boisterous, articulate, blessed with exceptional candor and a personality larger than life. He belonged to a class of his own.

He was among the earliest to console and encourage me when misfortune tended to overwhelm me. He cheered me up in the most memorable way when triumph came my way: to celebrate the success of my re-election as Chief Executive in 2007, he organized a choral mass with symphonic accompaniment at the Catholic Cathedral.

As entrepreneur from Hong Kong he was par excellence. His commercial ventures were always characterised by creativity and his ethnic origin. He had no equal in the way he profiled the positive image of Hong Kong among the the upper social, economic, cultural and political echelons on the world stage. His weekly article in the Financial Times was most popularly read throughout the world.

He died as a happy soul and a man of immense dignity and grace.

Hong Kong has lost a hero.
