# 我的周末歌單75-Paul McCartney & Wings - Band On The Run (JC VOCALS)


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629211009if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fOff3kX6IU" >}}


Stuck inside these four walls   
 Sent inside forever   
 Never seeing no one nice again,   
 Like you, mama   
 You, mama...   
 You...

If I ever get out of here   
 Thought of giving it all away   
 To a registered charity.   
 All I need is a pint a day   
 If I ever get out of here   
 (if we ever get out of here)

Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash   
 As we fell into the sun   
 And the first one said to the second one there,   
 "I hope you're having fun."

Band on the run, band on the run   
 And the jailer man,   
 And sailor Sam   
 Were searching everyone   
 For the band on the run, band on the run.   
 For the band on the run, band on the run.

Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh   
 Seeing no one else had come   
 And a bell was ringing in the village square   
 For the rabbits on the run.

Band on the run, band on the run   
 And the jailer man,   
 And sailor Sam   
 Were searching everyone   
 For the band on the run, band on the run.

Yeah, the band on the run   
 The band on the run   
 Band on the run   
 Band on the run

Well, the night was falling   
 As the desert world began to settle down   
 In the town they're searching for us everywhere   
 But we never will be found

Band on the run, band on the run   
 And the county judge, who held a grudge   
 Will search for ever more.   
 For the band on the run   
 Band on the run   
 Band on the run   
 Band on the run

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
