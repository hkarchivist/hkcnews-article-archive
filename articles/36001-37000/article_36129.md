# The Three Musketeers, you have my tears…

Alarm went off, didn’t feel quite ready to take on the day, reached over and hit the snooze button. Weird, got butterflies in my stomach, decided to crawl out of my bunk.

Instead of dashing to the loo, grabbed my phone and checked for tittle-tattle.

What the xxxx! A news flash from The Standard caught my eyes right away:

> **…activists Joshua Wong Chi-fung, Agnes Chow Ting and Ivan Lam Long-yin have been sentenced to 13.5 months, 10 months and seven months in jail respectively over charges of inciting people to besiege the police headquarters in Wan Chai in June last year.**

What have they done?? Did they kill anyone and left the naked corpse floating in the water?? Did they bash anyone brutally with a baton?? Did they rugby-tackle an innocent unarmed 12 year old girl to the ground??

Nope, they haven’t. So, what have they done?

They expressed their opinions, they joined other enthusiastic citizens to fight for freedom for democracy & freedom for Hong Kong.

Does that mean there is no more freedom of speech??? No more freedom of assembly??? No more Basic Law??? If so, just say it!!! You hypocrite!!!

> **“The imprisonment today of Joshua Wong, Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow – all of them campaigners for the rule of law and democracy in Hong Kong – is another grim example of China’s determination to put Hong Kong in handcuffs.”** said Chris Patten, ex-Hong Kong governor.


Remember, prisons cannot lock souls up, nor can cages curb people’s enthusiasm.

It’s devastating…. Three Musketeers, you have my tears….
