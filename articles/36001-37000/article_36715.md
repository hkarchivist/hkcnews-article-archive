# 大腦中的監視器°

【撰文：Berlina】

She took a step out from the TV screen   
 and crossed the street   
 in Berliner black   
 with a matching Pleats Please bag   
 and asked，戴了帽子也給認出來？

你尋找一種色彩°

Her follower   
 Gives her followers followers   
 Followed with an invite   
 to the grand Club named after you-know-where   
 where they serve Lion Head*   
 Even to vegetarians

換一個姿勢°   
 They offer to take the soiled loafers   
 on board their luxury yacht

從外面回家°   
 房間等同於天堂°   
 換一種記憶°   
 守著那把空椅子°

° = lines from Van Gogh and You by Liu Xiaobo (2007)   
 * = 獅子頭the Shanghainese cuisine; also reference Jimmy Lai´s Apple Daily column 《飛翔吧　良知的脊梁在撑着》

p.s. This writing is inspired by Liu Xia´s recital of the Liu Xiaobo´s poem Van Gogh and You (2007) in December 2020 and hence the lines taken from the poem. It connects the dots of a Berliner´s eventful encounters over the course of 9 months following a chance encounter with Liu Xia. All those perceived implications of the events cannot be verified, and they might as well be paranoid thoughts. However, the title gives some clue as why the events are read as they are. For those who have even the slightest heartless brush with you-know-what, a censor would naturally root in their heads.
