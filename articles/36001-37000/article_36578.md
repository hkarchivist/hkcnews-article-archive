### Sentencing Socrates to death

The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates (469 – 399 B.C.) is undoubtedly one of the greatest minds of the humankind. The story of his trial and death occupies a central place in Western civilization and beyond, comparable perhaps to the story of the trial and death of Jesus the Nazareth.

Socrates chose to obey the law rather than to escape for his life, even though he had good reason to believe that the verdict of putting him to death might be far from just. The relevance of Socrates’s death to us is direct when civil disobedience has become a well-supported practice in many quarters in the fight of justice in the contemporary world. It appears that to Socrates, fidelity to the law takes precedence over one’s life. Socrates seems to believe that it is better to die for one’s country and to submit to the death penalty rather than to be an outlaw. If so, does this belief contradict the practice of civil disobedience?

In a 1969 article (cf. “ *The Justifications of Civil Disobedience* ”), the late Harvard philosopher John Rawls famously argued that one can justifiably engage in civil disobedience if the following three conditions are satisfied. Firstly, when the law or policy that is the object of the person’s protest imposes a grave injustice on someone; secondly, when the person has already made a good faith effort to use all available lawful remedies to remove this injustice, but in vain; and, thirdly, when the protester is willing to grant to anyone else the right to use similar methods of protest to advance his conception of justice. Before I further examine this, let me briefly go over what had happened to Socrates prior to his trial and his death.

Socrates is perhaps the moral philosopher par excellence in the West. He was the one who believed that an unexamined life was not worth living. He spent his whole life trying to find answers to the question “how should one live?” Just before he entered the court-house in Athens to face his own trial, he still found time debating ethical issues with an acquaintance. In *The Last Days of Socrates* , Socrates’s disciple Plato describes in detail how Socrates faces the trial and his death in four Dialogues (namely: “Euthyphro”, “The Apology”, “Crito”, and “Phaedo”).

In the first Dialogue, Socrates debates the nature of piety or holiness with a young man named Euthyphro. The second Dialogue is the trial itself when Socrates faces charges of impiety and corrupting the young minds lodged by a fellow citizen. In the end, Socrates is found guilty by a democratically formed Athenian court and is condemned to death.

Some people think that those who plotted against him did so out of jealousy since Socrates was too popular among the young people. Others believe that it was some religious fundamentalists who plotted against him, for fear that his influence on the young minds might undermine people’s belief in gods and in political authority.

In the third Dialogue, Socrates counters the arguments of his loyal friend Crito, who tries to persuade Socrates to escape from the prison to save his life. Finally, the fourth Dialogue shows a calm and confident Socrates in the face of death and argues for the immortality of the soul.

Plato’s *The Last Days of Socrates* is an excellent read. It is both beautifully written and thought-provoking. Socrates’s main arguments against disobeying the laws can be found in the third Dialogue “Crito”, and it is to these arguments that we now turn.

### Socrates’s arguments against disobedience

In “Crito”, one can find that Socrates uses four related arguments to demonstrate to his friend Crito the reasons why he should prefer death to escape.

The first argument of Socrates is that as a citizen of Athens, he owes his moral and political existence, education and upbringing to the laws of the city-state. As such, he also shares in the benefits of it with other fellow citizens. Therefore, he has an obligation to obey the laws of Athens. Here are the words quoted by Socrates on this:

> Did we [i.e. the city-state and the laws] not give you life in the first place? Was it not through us that your father married your mother and brought you into this world?...[H]ave you any complaint against those of us Laws that deal with marriage?...[H]ave you any against the Laws which deal with children’s upbringing and education…? Are you not grateful to those of us Laws which were put in control of this, for requiring your father to give you an education…?

Secondly, Socrates argues that when a citizen who voluntarily stays in Athens and enjoys its benefits, it means that he has in fact entered into an agreement with the city-state to respect its laws and obey its judgments; particularly when the city-state allows him to leave if he does not want to enter into such an agreement. Thus, there is an obligation that once the agreement is made, the citizen is obliged to obey the laws, and one cannot and should not opt out when he finds that the laws are not favourable to him:

> Although we [i.e. the city-state and the laws] have brought you into the world and reared you and educated you, and given you and all your fellow-citizens a share in all the good things at our disposal, nevertheless by the very fact of granting our permission we openly proclaim this principle: that any Athenian, on attaining to manhood and seeing for himself the political organization of the State and us its Laws, is permitted, if he is not satisfied with us, to take his property and go away wherever he likes.

> …[I]f any one of you stand his ground when he can see how we administer justice and the rest of our public organization, we hold that by so doing he has in fact undertaken to do anything that we [i.e. the city-state and the laws] tell him.

These arguments not only support the position that citizens have a general duty to obey the law of their state, they also draw the conclusion that one should love one’s state, for “compared with your mother and father and all the rest of your ancestors your country is something far more precious, more venerable, more sacred, and held in greater honour both among gods and among all reasonable men.”

The third and fourth arguments of Socrates are somewhat negative in nature. To him, committing injustice or injury to others is morally wrong. Also, life is not worth living if law and order is gone. And not to obey the judgement of the law is unjust, and committing injustice is “in every case bad and dishonourable for the person who does it.” “Who could be pleased with a city without its laws?” Socrates asks.

### Socrates’s arguments examined

Let’s now get a closer look at Socrates’s arguments.

His first argument appears to have two aspects: one primordial and one utilitarian. Socrates believes that we as human individuals owe our moral and political existence (i.e. as a citizen to the city-state, knowing how to differentiate right from wrong) to the state and its laws. In other words, if we were born in the wilderness or in a stateless/anarchic situation, there is no law and order and hence no civilized life. In addition, we owe our upbringing, education and other benefits to the provisions secured by the state and the laws. We therefore should be grateful for that and should have the obligation to obey judgments made by the state and the laws.

But one may argue that the death sentence means the destruction of the individual, which makes the physical as well as the moral existence of that individual no longer possible. In that sense, what is the point of following the law’s judgment of this kind for the individual? As regards the utilitarian aspect of the argument, granted that there is a good reason for the citizen to follow the law if in doing so he could enjoy more social benefits, the same utilitarian logic would counsel that if on the contrary, by not following the law one could acquire more benefits, it is unreasonable to obey the law then.

That is why Socrates needs to come up with the “agreement” argument to further substantiate his position when he is reasoning with Crito. The fact that Athens allows its citizens to choose whether to stay or to leave when reaching adulthood may have two moral implications.

Firstly, conditions created by the state and the laws not only give birth to the moral individuals with political status, they also pay full respect to these individuals by allowing them to have their choice to stay or to leave when they are fully capable of making such a decision. Secondly, the state and the laws can continue to provide the conditions that made the moral and political existence of the individual possible only if the citizens honour their obligations to help promote, maintain and defend the state and its laws, without which sustainable civilized life is impossible. That is why when compared with the individual, the state is “more precious, more venerable, more sacred, and held in greater honour both among gods and among all reasonable men.”

Once after mature citizen has agreed to stay and continue to be a member of Athens, such an agreement incurs an absolute obligation on the citizen’s concern to stick to the state and the laws whether thick or thin. If one could renegade one’s obligations under adverse circumstances, it is morally and politically wrong, making the maintenance of the moral condition of the state impossible. In other words, even when the state, after having gone through the proper procedure, has arrived at a judgment against certain citizens, the citizens concerned have an inescapable duty to oblige.

In my view, the “agreement” argument is far more powerful than the utilitarian/primordial argument, but Socrates goes beyond it to further substantiate his position.

At the end of the fourth Dialogue “Phaedo”, shortly before submitting himself to the death penalty, Socrates speaks his last words to Crito: “Crito, we owe a cock to Asclepius. Please, don't forget to pay the debt.” In my view, these apparently simple words are important in understanding Socrates’s central moral and political position.

It is interesting to note that Socrates, who was condemned to death by the state because of convicted impiety, had his last words spoken to pay respect to the god of healing, Asclepius, son of divine Apollo.

Also, to pay one's debt to god before one is about to die is no consequentialist on moral matters, at least as far as one’s earthly life is concerned. To follow pious standards before one’s imminent demise is to insist on justice for justice sake, believing that pious standards go beyond one’s earthly life. An examined life, to Socrates, always means more than earthly outcomes. When an examined life comes to the end on earth, the meaning of examination goes on. That is why life, if examined, is meaningful even after it has ended. This, perhaps, is Socrates’s conception of immortality.

It is clear that in “Phaedo”, Socrates is depicted as both a law-abiding citizen (by willingly submitting to the death sentence) and a pious man following the standards of gods (paying respect to Asclepius through and through), even though the state and the laws have declared that he is impious and deserves to die. This means that in this case, the political and legal judgment of the state and the laws is inconsistent with the moral conduct of Socrates. Here politics and morality unhappily diverge.

The important point to note, however, is that Socrates did not, after his conviction, come to the conclusion that politics was wrong and he, as a moral being, was right. Instead, Socrates continued to argue that life was not worth living if law and order was gone. He continued to insist that not obeying the judgement of the law was wrong and was committing injustice.

In another Platonic dialogue Gorgias, Socrates says that for a moral individual, it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. Hannah Arendt takes this to mean that a moral individual always thinks about the moral quality of his conduct in his examined life. And since thinking always involves a two-in-one internal dialogue between the self and his conscience, if doing wrong to others means having a bad conscience for the individual (because one cannot deceive oneself), it will be a terribly unhappy life to live for a moral being since he carries this bad conscience with him all his life (cf. “Some Questions of Moral Philosophy”). In other words, to Socrates, even if it was the case that he suffered wrong from the state and the laws in his conviction, it was politically and morally better than if he were to do wrong to the state and the laws.

### Concluding remarks

Perhaps not all of us find Socrates’ arguments persuasive. But if we go back to the Rawlsian conditions of civil disobedience, it is clear that even if Socrates agreed that he had been subjected to a grave injustice incurred by the state and he had tried his best within legal limits to rectify that without success, he would not go all the way to endorse the view that he should grant himself and others the right of civil disobedience. Some of the powerful reasons given by Socrates are that: (1) we owe our moral and political existence to a lawful state; (2) not to obey the judgement of the law is legally unjust; (3) life is not worth living if law and order is gone; (4) committing injustice “is in every case [my italics] bad and dishonourable for the person who does it”; and (5) for a moral being, it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong.

In a nutshell, it seems that Socrates is of the view that moral judgment should not trump legal and political judgment, at least in a lawful city-state like Athens. To the civil dissenters, however, the legal and political judgement of a lawful state is never final, since, like Rawls, they believe that “if justified civil disobedience seems to threaten civic concord, the responsibility falls not upon those who protest but upon those whose abuse of authority and power justifies such opposition. For to employ the coercive apparatus of the state in order to maintain manifestly unjust institutions is itself a form of illegitimate force that men in due course have a right to resist.”

This, to Socrates, certainly is manifestly a moral judgment that prefers political discord to moral wrongs.
