# An elite school, what a woe……

“Once a Paulinian, forever a Paulinian….”. I don’t expect everyone of you have heard of this but, as a Paulinian, I am always proud to be a Paulinian.

Well, until a few weeks ago……..

Wondering why? Simply google this: **elite school national security law** .

Found anything? Try clicking on the links, you may see this (not every link leads you to the below, but at least one link does):

Goodness……what a chicken……

Long story short, not mentioning any name, an elite secondary school in Hong Kong will be giving lessons on national security law – and it’s the very first secondary school to do so. What makes it more absurd? Since last year, my beloved mother school has expressed to students that they should not bring politics onto the campus, but now, national security law will be added as a class topic.

Last year, the school asked students to toss away flyers distributed by alumnae – alumnae who staged human chain protests outside the campus (picture below); students were, and still are, refrained from organizing any class boycott activities.

As an elite school with over 165 years of history, why on earth does this reputable private catholic school need to ingratiate?

Thanks to different alumnae from the school and its sister’s schools, we managed to crowdfund sufficient fund to express our feelings towards this ridiculous, non-sense and humiliating ingratiation via A1 page on AppleDaily – please show your support & grab a copy, 8th October 2020!
