Mary Hopkin - Those Were The Days

Once upon a time there was a tavern   
 Where we used to raise a glass or two   
 Remember how we laughed away the hours   
 And dreamed of all the great things we could do

Those were the days my friend   
 We thought they'd never end   
 We'd sing and dance forever and a day   
 We'd live the life we choose   
 We'd fight and never lose   
 For we were young and sure to have our way.

Then the busy years went rushing by us   
 We lost our starry notions on the way   
 If by chance I'd see you in the tavern   
 We'd smile at one another and we'd say

Those were the days my friend   
 We thought they'd never end   
 We'd sing and dance forever and a day   
 We'd live the life we choose   
 We'd fight and never lose   
 Those were the days, oh yes those were the days   
 La la la la...

Just tonight I stood before the tavern   
 Nothing seemed the way it used to be   
 In the glass I saw a strange reflection   
 Was that lonely woman really me

Through the door there came familiar laughter   
 I saw your face and heard you call my name   
 Oh my friend we're older but no wiser   
 For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
