# 林鄭曾俊華為曾蔭權撰寫求情信全文

## **林鄭月娥撰寫求信情全文**

The Honourable Mr. Justice Andrew Chan

The High Court, Admiralty, Hong Kong

Dear Sir,

  
 Re: **Mr. Donald TSANG Yam-kuen**

As the Honourable Court may recall, I was a witness in the case of Donald Tsang Yam-kuen. I write this letter to pray that your Lordship may extend leniency to Mr. Tsang.

I have known Donald for over 30 years. As I said during the trial, he had been my role model in public service. For seven years between 1993 and 2000, he was my supervisor in the then Finance Branch and later Finance Bureau. I saw a hard-working, dedicated, and intelligent senior official who was a demanding yet caring supervisor.

Donald's contribution as the first Chinese Financial Secretary and the Financial Secretary whose term straddled 1997 deserves special mention. In leading us to complete the 1997-1998 transitional Budget, he helped make real the principle of "One Country, Two Systems". He also showed his strong compassion for those in need by putting in place a package of relief measures in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis.

His perseverance in pressing ahead with difficult policy decisions and his untiring efforts in working with Legislative Council members across the political spectrum were exemplary. His skillful management of public finances and vision in embarking on a wide ranging Public Sector reform laid a foundation for Hong Kong’s fiscal strength after the Reunification.

I was particularly indebted to Donald for the trust he placed in me in those years as well as during my five-year tenure as the Secretary for Development supporting policy innovation for bettering our society.

After serving his term as Chief Executive, Donald contributed to care about our society and to show support to former colleagues. I recall that during the very difficult times of my handling the constitutional development issue, we met at a dinner. He made a point of encouraging me , and wrote on the menu, "Have faith in the people of Hong Kong." Those are indeed wise words, and I have kept the menu with his handwritten note up to this day.

It is well known that Donald is a devout Catholic. Over the years, he has often shared with me the importance of faith and trust in God and that when the going gets tough, we should keep calm and pray. Whatever transgressions he may have committed, I believe Donald is overall an upright and a man committed to service.

I pray that your Lordship may find it appropriate to show leniency to Mr. Tsang and, as I have said in public, I hope his contribution to Hong Kong would continue to be recognized.

Yours humbly,

Carrie Lam

高等法院陳慶偉法官：

我1981年在哈佛大學攻讀公共行政碩士時，結識當時被港府保送到哈佛修讀同一課程的曾蔭權。在曾蔭權鼓勵下，我1982年回流返港投考政務官，更擔任沙田助理政務專員，而當時的上司就是曾蔭權。及至2005年，更成為出任行政長官的曾蔭權的特首辦主任，其後擔任財政司司長。

我認識了曾蔭權36年，並曾經一起在政府共事30年。在這30年的同事關係中，我見證了他對服務香港的熱誠，不管是在1998年的金融風暴中抵禦金融大鱷，還是在2003年沙士後領導政府各部門改善本港的衛生情況，以及後來排除萬難的推行最低工資，他都是全心全意的以香港市民的利益為依歸。

我在2005至2007年間出任特首辦主任，深知行政長官的繁重工作，而凡是會對市民大眾帶來深切影響的政策，曾蔭權例必特別上心，我相信不少同事都會依然記得他那些午夜電郵及假日電話。

曾蔭權在政府工作了45年，鞠躬盡瘁，我期望法官可以念及他對社會作出了45年的貢獻，從輕發落，免他在72歲之齡受牢獄之災。

祝安好!

曾俊華
