# My trip starts

編者按：BeBe是《眾新聞》的新專欄作者。用他自己的話：「一個62歲老餅，退休18天後，便隻身踏足西班牙，老婆又肯俾批文，用最平的方法，去完成42年前大學時的夢想：流浪歐洲」。這是他的遊記。

> Jan 17 Hong Kong   
>  Thank you Dear Eli n Doug to walk me to the E21 bus stop.   
>  My trip starts.

I am coming with my host family with Google translate as he does not know English.

I did more study of my route.   
 I will leave Madrid 2/11 n need to be in Manchester 4/12.

I can either to spend the entire time in Spain n enjoy every Spain city slowly n fly from Spain to Manchester.

Or take a land route to go thru France, take ferry to England n pass thru few cities.  If I do that, I need to stop 22 cities in 60 days or 3 nights every city.  The bus, train n ferry will be very expensive and too tiring.

Just check a one way ticket from Barcelona to Manchester is only HK$550.

Let me see how my first week in Madrid goes before I make a final decision.

## Jan 18 Madrid

Had my first one-on-one Spanish in the plane as the guy next to me Jeff cannot speak English   
 He taught me like 10 pages of notes including Monday, Tuesday, boy, girl etc

He is Pakistan origin owning a plastic factory in Burgos, 240 km north of Madrid. I will visit him in March n stay few days in his home.

Very sunny here like California.

Our host family is in a neighborhood like Mongkok or ShamShuiPo. Not very nice n have a few hard ware stores n lighting stores. These pictures are one subway station from my apartment, nicer.

Thank you dear Eli to buy me this hat. I wore it today. Even though it is sunny but very cold. I bet it is zero degree.

HK$210 bought all these fruits, nuts, veritable and wine from Supermarket. The wine is only HK$14. Should be enough for 3 meals.

First tapas bar. Hk$50 for 2 tapas n 1 beer.

Second tapas bar at HK$57. The fish is 2 portions of a fine dining restaurant. It is Portuguese fried cod fish called Bacalau 馬介休. Very expensive in Macau.
