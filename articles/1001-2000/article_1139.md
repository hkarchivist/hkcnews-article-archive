I've Got Dreams To Remember

I've got dreams, dreams to remember   
 I've got dreams, dreams to remember

Honey, I saw you there last night   
 Another man's arms holding you tight   
 Nobody knows what I feel inside   
 All I know, I walked away and cried

I've got dreams   
 Dreams to remember   
 Listen to me   
 (I've got dreams) rough dreams (dreams to remember)

I know you said he was just a friend   
 But I saw him kiss you again and again   
 These eyes of mine, they don't fool me   
 Why did he hold you so tenderly?

I've got dreams   
 Dreams to remember   
 Listen, honey   
 (I've got dreams) rough dreams (dreams to remember)

I still want you to stay   
 I still love you anyway   
 I don't want you to ever leave   
 Girl, you just satisfy me, ooh-wee

I know you said he was just a friend   
 But I saw you kiss him again and again   
 These eyes of mine, they don't fool me   
 Why did he hold you so tenderly?

I've got dreams   
 Dreams to remember   
 Listen to me, mama   
 (I've got dreams) bad dreams, rough dreams, oh (dreams to remember)   
 Don't make me suffer, don't let me   
 (I've got dreams, dreams, dreams to remember) rough dreams, bad dreams, rough dreams

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
