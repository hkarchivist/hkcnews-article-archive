# 我的周末歌單12－10CC- I'm Not in love


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711084822if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/7evTsECtW_A" >}}


I'm not in love   
 So don't forget it   
 It's just a silly phase I'm going through   
 And just because   
 I call you up   
 Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made   
 I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you   
 But then again   
 That doesn't mean you mean that much to me   
 So if I call you   
 Don't make a fuss   
 Don't tell your friends about the two of us   
 I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture   
 Upon the wall   
 It hides a nasty stain that's lying there   
 So don't you ask me   
 To give it back   
 I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me   
 I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me   
 Ooh you'll wait a long time   
 Ooh you'll wait a long time for me   
 Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love   
 So don't forget it   
 It's just a silly phase I'm going through   
 And just because I call you up   
 Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made   
 I'm not in love   
 I'm not in love

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
