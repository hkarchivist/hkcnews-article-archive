# 我的周末歌單15－The Beatles - The Long and Winding Road (LIVE - 90's)

The Long And Winding Road

The long and winding road   
 That leads to your door   
 Will never disappear   
 I've seen that road before   
 It always leads me here   
 Lead me to your door

The wild and windy night   
 That the rain washed away   
 Has left a pool of tears   
 Crying for the day   
 Why leave me standing here   
 Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone   
 And many times I've cried   
 Any way you'll never know   
 The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back   
 To the long winding road   
 You left me standing here   
 A long long time ago   
 Don't leave me waiting here   
 Lead me to your door

But still they lead me back   
 To the long winding road   
 You left me standing here   
 A long long time ago   
 Don't keep me waiting here   
 Lead me to your door   
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
