# 我的周末歌單11－The Moody Blues - Nights In White Satin


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711084821if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQ49LBLUPDw" >}}


Nights in white satin,   
 Never reaching the end,   
 Letters I've written,   
 Never meaning to send.

Beauty I'd always missed   
 With these eyes before,   
 Just what the truth is   
 I can't say anymore.

'Cause I love you,   
 Yes, I love you,   
 Oh, how I love you.

Gazing at people,   
 Some hand in hand,   
 Just what I'm going through   
 They can't understand.

Some try to tell me   
 Thoughts they cannot defend,   
 Just what you want to be   
 You will be in the end,

And I love you,   
 Yes, I love you,   
 Oh, how I love you.   
 Oh, how I love you.

'Cause I love you,   
 Yes, I love you,   
 Oh, how I love you.   
 Oh, how I love you.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
