"Saturday In The Park"

Saturday in the park   
 I think it was the Fourth of July   
 Saturday in the park   
 I think it was the Fourth of July   
 People dancing, people laughing   
 A man selling ice cream   
 Singing Italian songs   
 Eh cumpari, ci vo sunari   
 Can you dig it (yes, I can)   
 And I've been waiting such a long time   
 For Saturday

Another day in the park   
 I think it was the Fourth of July   
 Another day in the park   
 I think it was the Fourth of July   
 People talking, really smiling   
 A man playing guitar (play a song, play a song, play on)   
 Singing for us all (singing for us)   
 Will you help him change the world   
 Can you dig it (yes, I can)   
 And I've been waiting such a long time   
 For today

Slow motion riders fly the colours of the day   
 A bronze man still can tell stories his own way   
 Listen children all is not lost, all is not lost   
 Oh no, no

Forty days in the park   
 And every day's the Fourth of July   
 Forty days in the park   
 Every day's the Fourth of July   
 People reaching, people touching   
 A real celebration   
 Waiting for us all (waiting for us all)   
 If we want it, really want it   
 Can you dig it (yes, I can)   
 And I've been waiting such a long time   
 For the day   
 Yeah, yeah, yeah

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
