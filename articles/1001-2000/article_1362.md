# History as Mirror

(This is the speech given by Peter Lai Hing-ling, former Secretary for Security, at the kick-starting ceremony of the 155th anniversary of Queen's College, his alma mater, on January 23, 2017.)

What do you see in a physical mirror? Yourself, of course. But, you also see quite a bit of your surroundings, which fix your spatial position and, to an extent, your temporal frame of reference. If for example there is a digital clock on the wall behind you visible in the mirror, then you can place yourself in time too.

What do you see in the metaphorical mirror of History? The past, of course, but you will be seeing that past from the perspective of your present. Indeed, you should be seeing your present self, set against the context of not just your past, but the whole community's past. If you set the parameters wide enough you see yourself against the past of the entire history of humanity. The budding astronomers amongst you should be even more comfortable with the cosmological analogy that we are all stardust, born of supernovae from aeon past, through the entire history of Time. "To know thyself is the beginning of wisdom", so said the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. But, you cannot really know yourself fully without knowing something of your past, because you are a product of that past.

## The development of a local administrative elite in Hong Kong

Let me illustrate by taking as an example some of the familiar names in Hong Kong's political life that you most often hear today. Most of them have like me joined the Administrative Service of the Hong Kong Government from the 1970's, and rose through the ranks at pace; they are more or less my contemporaries. If you look more closely at the history of Hong Kong in the last 30 years of the 20th century, which saw amongst other things the development of a local administrative elite, the conclusion that you will reach is – we are all a child of the time, benefitting from the expansion of opportunities that opened up during that period of Hong Kong's history.

Prior to, say, the 1950's for all practical purposes the influence of local university graduates in the public administration of Hong Kong was small, by virtue of the fact that the number of them within the government was extremely low. The administration of Hong Kong then was effectively in the hands of largely expatriate, colonial civil servants from Britain. While the odd locals might have exercised some degree of influence on specific issues or instances they did so from the outside, and their influence was only at the discretion (willingly or otherwise) of the British colonial administration. Some local graduates did join up in the 1960's, but the numbers were still small – around 2 per year. In contrast, in the 1970's the increasing dominance of local intakes especially from Hong Kong universities into the Administrative Service, meant that locals were increasingly formulating policies and taking decisions on the way that Hong Kong was run; in short they become part of the governing elite of Hong Kong. By 1997 they have effectively dominated the ranks of the public service. Do not underestimate this change – it underpins a fundamental shift in the ethos of the senior civil service of the Hong Kong Government – from one of "overlord" to one of "leader of the pack".

## Expansion of the Public Service since the 1970's

Three factors were primarily responsible for the increasing dominance of local public officers since the 1970's. First, the coming of age of the baby boomer generation; born in the 1948-1965 period they reached adulthood and, for the academically gifted, attained university graduate status beginning in the early 1970's. They were then fully qualified to enter public service in their various professions, but most significantly as Administrative Officers (AO's) – the entry rank of the elite Administrative Service, which still occupies the majority of the directorate ranks. In other words, the supply of trained people began just at the time they were needed in increasing numbers.

Secondly, the demand for young local graduates, including those who were educated in overseas tertiary institutions, vastly expanded in the 1970's both in the public and the private sectors, and this continued into the 1990's. This was partly a reflection of the realization by the colonial power that the governing elite over the preceding decades had been far too isolated from the rest of the community, with power being held by a few expatriates though garnished with a sprinkling of local-Chinese elites. This had contributed to the massive scale of the 1967 riots in Hong Kong. It also partly reflected the increasing need for a substantially larger core of key civil servants (not just in the Administrative Service but also in the professions) to staff the massive investments in public services and programmes (in housing, medical facilities, infrastructure, education, etc.) that the HKG embarked on under Governor MacLehose and continued well into the 1990's. The size of the civil service establishment that made possible this vast expansion, for example, increased from 90 000 in 1973 to 190 000 in 1997, despite the hiving off of some functions to non-civil service organizations (e.g. Hospital Authority) in later decades. At the same time reforming the central governmental system, namely the new Government Secretariat structure with more and better staffed policy branches, resulted in a greater demand for staff in the graduate grades.

Beginning in late 1960's a concerted effort to reach out to the community politically was launched with the district administration scheme; this was vastly expanded in the 1970's, which again imposed an even greater demand for more staff to support them. As a result, for example, the intake of local graduates into the civil service increased tremendously in the 1970's and continued well beyond into the 1990's. Some figures on the intake of local graduates into the AO Grade serve to illustrate:

- intake in 1960's – 2 per year

- intake in 1970's – 7.5 per year

- intake in 1980's – 15.6 per year

- intake in 1990's – 25.8 per year

Thirdly, with the settlement of the future of Hong Kong after the ratification of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the pace of localization in the higher ranks of the public service speeded up, and the previous practice of recruiting AO's and Police Inspectors directly from Britain ended. The object was to ensure that the Hong Kong public service by 1997 would be substantially manned by local (i.e. Hong Kong Chinese) officers, so that the best of them (who are permanent residents of Hong Kong with no right of abode elsewhere) could smoothly move into "principal official" posts in the run up to the transition. As a result the cohort of local university graduates recruited into the elite ranks of the civil service entered the decade of the 1990's in their prime – 40 to 50 age group – and, given the increasing pace of localization, many of them rose rapidly up the ladder of (bureaucratic) success to the top ranks of the administration. The proportion of local officers in the directorate increased from 47.3% in 1984 to 77% in 1997; the proportion of local officers in the Administrative Service increased at an even quicker pace – from 55.7% in 1984 to 85.2% in 1997. Indeed, of the 23 Principal Officials (primarily Secretaries and Bureau Directors, excluding the Chief Executive) in place on 1 July 1997 19 of them (or 82.6%) were Hong Kong university graduates. It should be noted that practically all of them were civil servants in place before 1 July 1997, of which the bulk was from the ranks of the Administrative Service (AO's).

I dare say you will find some of their names still around, active in public and/or academic life. I hope with this little sketch of the history of the Hong Kong public service in the last 30 years of the 20th century you can see how social and political developments opened up the career path of local university graduates, including those names which you now associate with the highest ranks of political elite in the Hong Kong SAR. This does not in any way detract from their individual abilities, merely that their emergence into the political limelight must be seen against developments in the last quarter century. I am sure that new developments in the 21st century will open up your career opportunities, perhaps in a direction very different from the past, and that like them you will also one day be bathed in the limelight.

## Re-evaluation of Hong Kong's future role: the importance of learning from the past

If you wish to understand yourself you must understand also the history of all the forces and environment that shaped you. Same goes for the views you take of various developments that affect us, or will potentially affect us, directly or indirectly. Hong Kong is at present engaged in a rethinking of our role, our values and our future direction. To take Hong Kong as is as the sole starting point would be insufficient at best, dangerous at worst. There can be no sensible debate about Hong Kong’s future without taking account our shared history – including our British colonial past, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, the Basic Law, amongst other things. ***To enable us to have a sensible debate on our future we need to be firmly grounded on a thorough understanding of our past.***

As the famous Emperor Taizhong of the Tang Dynasty said in the 7th century: 以 古為鑑, 可知興替. Closer to our time, the Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana also said, "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Let me give an even more recent example. The more senior boys amongst you will perhaps recall the financial crisis of 2008 which, at one stage, threatened to tailspin into a global economic meltdown. Luckily, for us and for the world economy, we seemed to have remembered the Great Depression (1929-33) which happened some 80 years ago, starting with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and spreading through the world in the next decade like contagion, and was instrumental in the making of World War II. It seems we have learnt the lessons of the past, so that collectively the world’s major economies incl. China managed to avoid making the same mistakes as many of the decision makers did some 80 years ago. So, you see, a close understanding of our history has practical application too. Those of you who will pursue further studies in business (or public) administration will no doubt learn the importance of the case study approach; that approach actually is very much a particular way of studying history – of a private company, a government agency or a quasi-governmental body, a public policy or a private entrepreneurial decision – and with practical application to boot.

## The debate on history teaching

I am sure you are all aware of the on-going debate over the teaching of history in secondary schools. That sounds innocuous enough; after all, it is perhaps just an academic debate. However, in a politically charged environment there can be no more controversial debate than one on history and its teaching. After all, as George Orwell said: "Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past." Perhaps, those who are responsible for steering the debate in Hong Kong might well learn a great deal from the controversy over what history to teach that poisoned a similar public debate in the United States of America in the 1990's, starting with the Presidency of George Bush Senior and continuing into the Presidency of Bill Clinton.

That said, I am no educator, and am perfectly happy to defer to the experts in the profession. Allow me however to make a plea on behalf of all the consumers of education (i.e. students): in keeping with the "mirror" analogy of this title the best approach to teaching history might well be to reverse the arrow of time. We should perhaps start from the near present and work our way back to the past. Some of you might think that I am putting the cart before the horse or, as we Chinese say, 本末倒置. Not so, for there is nothing more important in education than stimulating the interest of the students; using the (near) present as the starting point is immensely more interesting than starting from pre-history and working your way through 4000 years to the present.

## Globalization and history

The focus of the debate on history teaching has been, naturally enough, on Chinese History. After all, the first duty of a citizen is to know the history of his or her own nation, culture or community. I should however like to inject a point that seems to me to have been generally glossed over in the debate so far, and that is - we need to understand not only our own history, but also the history of other peoples and other cultures. If you do not know the history of another people, you will not understand their values, their fears, their hopes, or how they are likely to react to something you do, or say. Worse still, you may then assume that other people think just like you, want the same things you do, and react to a given set of circumstances in exactly the same way you do. And that would be making a huge, huge mistake. The best example in recent history is the American involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960's and early 1970's. The then U.S. Secretary for Defence Robert McNamara confessed, years too late, that "Our misjudgement of friend and foe alike reflected our profound ignorance of the history, culture, and politics of the people in the area and personalities and habits of their leaders." (In Retrospect). That misjudgement caused many deaths and untold suffering to millions more in the form of displaced persons; even Hong Kong was not immune, for we had to devote a Herculean effort, and a great deal of our scarce resources, to cope humanely with the flood of up to a quarter of a million Vietnamese boat people in the last quarter of the 20th century.

You might well ask, should that be a matter of concern to you individually in the 21st century? I would answer unequivocally yes. In this globalized world you will have to deal with people from different cultures with different sensitivities, whether you are in business, the professions or in public life. For example:

- You are likely at some stage of your professional life to have to work with people of a different nationality or culture, in particular your colleagues in a multinational company or academic institution;

- You may well have the opportunity to go overseas for your further education, or specialist training; and

- You may well have to negotiate with a whole range of different people from afar, either in a collegiate or an adversarial context, on behalf of the company or public body you work for.

Lack of understanding of other cultures and societies may cause not just embarrassment; it could potentially make life very difficult especially when, increasingly, we need other people’s cooperation to tackle global problems. So, know thyself by all means but know others as well.

## The dangers of abuse of History

Let me also put in another caveat in the context of the history debate – that is on the abuse of history that has so often happened in the past. I can do no better than to quote the eminent Canadian historian and Warden of St. Anthony's College, Oxford, Professor Margaret MacMillan, who cautioned that: "History is often used as a series of moral tales, to enhance group solidarity… and so the teaching of the past has been central to the debates over how to instil and transmit values. The danger is that what may be an admirable goal can distort history either by making it into a simple narrative in which there are black-and-white characters, or by depicting it as all tending in one direction, whether that of human progress or the triumph of a particular group. Such history flattens out the complexity of human experience and leaves no room for different interpretations of the past." (Dangerous Games: The Uses and Abuses of History, (2008), p. 114.) Bits of the past are often prayed in aid, selectively, to justify one cause or another, to whip up public sentiment, or to air-brush mistakes when they cannot be explained away. We need to be alive to the dangers of believing these false claims. As always, the test is in examining all the facts and drawing conclusions from evidence-based research, and not on propagandistic bombasts from the high and mighty. Let reasoned debate, not angry sloganeering, prevail.

## Looking forward, optimistically

Finally, I would like to sound an optimistic note. Our most distinguished alumnus, Dr Sun Yat Sen, indisputably made history. He did so despite all the odds, not by going with the flow. One day, some of you (my younger brothers) might very well make history too, for our community, for the nation, and indeed for the world, whether in politics or medicine, in business or in law, in the sciences or in the arts. "Man make their own history," said Karl Marx, "but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past." Or, put in another way by Sir Isaac Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all time: "If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." Let me end with the famous words of Nobel Laureate T.S. Eliot, who began his monumental poem, the "Four Quartets", with these words:

"Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future And time future contained in time past."

***Past, present and future are all a continuum, and we can no more ignore the past as we can ignore the present, as we continue our journey into the future.***
