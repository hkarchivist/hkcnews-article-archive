# Trump got trumped again!

【Written by: Kayser】

Trump got trumped again!

Tonight (Thursday February 9, EST) marked another blow to Trump's anti-Muslim travel ban!

As we recall, last Friday Washington and Minnesota States jointly declared Trump's travel ban "unconstitutional" and "unlawful", and demanded a halt to its execution.

Granted by District Court Federal Judge James Robart, the travel ban was temporarily stopped until further court hearings.

With the ruling, the Customs and Border Protection immediately communicated to the airlines, allowing the visa processing to resume as before the ban time. The Department of Homeland Security chimed in to revert the course of banning nationwide.

Infuriated, the Tweeter-in-Chief fired back, tweeting Robart as the "so-called judge", and announced his determination for appeal.

The next day, the Trump White House appealed to the Court of Appeal to overturn / freeze Robart's ruling. But his request was quickly revoked.

The three judges unanimously ruled against resuming the ban, defeating the oft-defiant new president.

Why did the Trump travel ban face so many roadblocks?

Outside the court, people dissented and protested against the ban for moral reasons – that the ban was inhumane, and that it seemed discriminatory.

Inside the court, Bob Ferguson, Attorney General of Washington State, argued rather on the damage that the ban brought to his state's economy, education, residents and employers. The ban fundamentally broke many families.

And blocking only Muslims and not Christians constituted religious discrimination, as laid out in the First Amendment of the Constitution in relation to religious rights.

The White House, on the other hand, focused on the president’s constitutional power in issuing executive orders to ensure national security, and the president’s decision being "unreviewable", even by the court!

The problem is: the firm stand from the White House was not supported by strong evidence. Or any evidence at all. In fact, the Court of Appeal gave Trump an opportunity to present proof and evidence where the residents of the 7 identified Muslim-majority countries and Syrian refugees indeed present imminent dangers. The White House, however, presented nothing!

As if this is not bad enough, Trump didn't seem to understand the problem and tweeted, in all caps, SEE YOU IN COURT!

The next step will be the Supreme Court, likely a few months later – and this could inadvertently dwarf Trump's original claim that the country's security was "at stake"!

Suppose Trump can simply take back his controversial executive order's ban, resolve all constitutional and legal conflicts, re-write the executive order, and announce a new one.

Unfortunately, given his temperament and never-yielding attitude, it's unlikely Trump would apologize and do the next plausible thing. Trump is Trump. He will continue being Trumpish, dragging his first 100 days to a spiral of lawsuits.

Narcissistic and arrogant, sans political knowledge or experience, Trump conjured a coterie of close aides equally incompetent and inexperienced, sharing only inflated egos and no real plan to make America great again.

The hiccup in his travel ban executive order may haunt him in the long run. If he cannot change the way he handles issues, he could continue to live in political crises. His Republic Party may suffer from the mid-term election. And he may continue to experience a crippling presidency, an inevitable result from his own impasses with practically everyone.

Some may say it's nothing wrong in trying to protect the country at all cost. But in a country of democracy, this serves true only partially. Our experience can tell the best.

This is how human rights are exemplified – we are equal regardless of our race, color, religion, gender…..

We the people are all equal, and it’s all written in our Constitution.

With this guiding principle, despite its imperfections, people from all over the world flood to America, in search of this "American Dream". Even if it may seem a beautiful lie, people would still choose to live in a place with hope and possibilities.

And that's why no matter how successfully or humbly a refugee may end up living, they cheer for those who bear their prior identities.

This is America and it's filled with all these stories.

## A truck driver once told me, "No matter where you came from, as long as you live here, we are family."

If you can understand these words, you would understand why so many people stand strong and defend for principles.

Hong Kong. New York. Eight thousand miles from each other. A half-day apart. Two vibrant cities with different cultural and political backgrounds, experiencing their respective changes in this cross-road time of history. Reflections upon one, perhaps, may shed light upon the other. Florence & Kayser, two Hong Kongers living in America sharing thoughts and stories of the big Apple and beyond.
