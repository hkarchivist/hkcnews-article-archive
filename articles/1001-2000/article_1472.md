# 我的周末歌單10－Carole King - You've got a friend


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210711084819if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XGX98OW4Rc" >}}


When you're down and troubled,   
 And you need some love and care,   
 And nothing, nothing is going right   
 Close your eyes and think of me,   
 And soon I will be there   
 To brighten up even your darkest night.

You just call out my name   
 And you know wherever I am   
 I'll come running to see you again   
 Winter, spring, summer or fall   
 All you have to do is call   
 And I'll be there   
 You've got a friend

If the sky above you grows dark and full of clouds   
 And that old north wind begins to blow   
 Keep your head together and call my name out loud   
 Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

You just call out my name   
 And you know wherever I am   
 I'll come running, running, yeah, yeah, to see you again   
 Winter, spring, summer or fall   
 All you have to do is call   
 And I'll be there   
 And I'll be there, yes I will.

Now, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend   
 When people can be so cold?   
 They'll hurt you, yes, and desert you   
 And take your soul if you let them,   
 Oh, but don't you let them

You just call out my name   
 And you know wherever I am   
 I'll come running, running, yeah, yeah, yeah, to see you again.   
 Winter, spring, summer or fall   
 All you have to do is call   
 And I'll be there, yes I will.   
 You've got a friend

You've got a friend   
 Ain't it good to know, you've got a friend?   
 Ain't it good to know?   
 Ain't it good to know?   
 Ain't it good to know, you've got a friend?

Oh yeah, now   
 Oh, you've got a friend   
 Yeah, baby   
 You've got a friend   
 Oh yeah...   
 You've got a friend

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
