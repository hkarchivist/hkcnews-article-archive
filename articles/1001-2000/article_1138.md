The Sound of Silence (Original Version from 1964)

"The Sound Of Silence"

Hello darkness, my old friend   
 I've come to talk with you again   
 Because a vision softly creeping   
 Left its seeds while I was sleeping   
 And the vision that was planted in my brain   
 Still remains   
 Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone   
 Narrow streets of cobblestone   
 ‘Neath the halo of a streetlamp   
 I turned my collar to the cold and damp   
 When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light   
 That split the night   
 And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw   
 Ten thousand people, maybe more   
 People talking without speaking   
 People hearing without listening   
 People writing songs that voices never share   
 No one dare   
 Disturb the sound of silence

“Fools” said I, “You do not know   
 Silence like a cancer grows   
 Hear my words that I might teach you   
 Take my arms that I might reach you”   
 But my words like silent raindrops fell   
 And echoed in the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed   
 To the neon god they made   
 And the sign flashed out its warning   
 In the words that it was forming   
 And the sign said “The words of the prophets   
 Are written on the subway walls   
 And tenement halls   
 And whispered in the sounds of silence”

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
