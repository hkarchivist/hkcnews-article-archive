This month Peter Mathieson, the University of Hong Kong's president and vice-chancellor, will leave his job the same way he arrived — dogged by controversy. Appointed to HKU's top spot in [April 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324223/peter-mathieson-appointed-new-hku-chief) , he cut short his five-year term in a [surprise announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/https://www.hku.hk/press/news_detail_15882.html) last February, revealing plans to head the University of Edinburgh.

Days before his departure, Mathieson gestured at the bare walls of his office (the photographs were taken down for shipping) and reflected on the "steep learning curve" he had to climb. He had recently written an optimistic [end-of-year message](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/12/21/outgoing-hku-president-peter-mathieson-says-no-regrets-occupy-visit/) , which served as both a policy report and a farewell note, but reception was [mixed at best](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/01/03/staff-survey-produces-scathing-reviews-outgoing-hku-chief-peter-mathieson/) .

"Everything at HKU is politicised, and I have had to accept that," he said. "I don't think it's ideal for the running of a university, but Hong Kong is a broad spectrum of political views, and the university has to reflect that."

Mathieson has a favourite phrase for his least favourite activity: "firefighting." His tenure coincided with high-profile political incidents, often landing him in the spotlight. Speaking to hKUDOS, Mathieson reflects on the moments that, for better or worse, will form part of his HKU legacy.

**HKU Council's [snub](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1862423/surprise-move-chair-university-hong-kong) of Johannes Chan Man-mun in 2015**

"My concern was not so much that Council made the decision they made, because that's within their rights. My issue was how long it took to make that decision. That process took basically a year, and that year was very damaging to HKU. … There would be people who would disagree with whatever decision Council made. But it would have been much better for the university for the decision to be made quickly, and we moved on."

"One of the unfair aspects was that Johannes Chan was portrayed, particularly by the media, as someone more interested in politics than he was in advancing law or the academic aspects of law. I don't think that's true."

**Students [protest](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1905784/surrounded-university-hong-kong-students-besiege-governing) against HKU Council at Sassoon Road in 2016**

"I did my best to diffuse what was a very difficult situation that night. It then got portrayed by some as me having changed from being the students' friend to the students' enemy, and that upset me. I never felt that was true or justified — and so I felt I was perhaps harshly judged."

**Discussions on [Hong Kong independence](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/11/07/hku-head-i-signed-anti-hong-kong-independence-statement-avoid-isolation-universities/) at HKU**

"On the question of whether HKU students should be able to discuss HK independence, my answer is unequivocal, I think they should. Discussing difficult issues, complicated issues — things which are currently impossible — is part of what universities should do."

"If I had my time again, I would probably want the statement to be clearer about exactly what we were condemning, because it was open to misinterpretation. [But] I think some of the people misinterpreted it cynically, out of political motives."

**Resignation**

"I never had the intention of using HKU as a stepping stone. … I was appointed to a five-year term: I was coming up to my fourth year, I had no idea whether I'd be offered a second term or not. There had been no discussions with the Council Chairman [Arthur Li Kwok-cheung] about a second term. So there was uncertainty for me about the future, and I didn't know when that decision was likely to be made."

**Appointment of [Zhang Xiang](https://web.archive.org/web/20210706105205/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2124533/renowned-scientist-professor-zhang-xiang-named-university) as HKU's next vice-chancellor**

"I know there has been some rumours, or discussions, about there being overseas candidates who were not considered suitable. I don't know if that's true or not. I would hope that if the panel felt they were not suitable, they were based on genuine academic and professional considerations, and not on ethnic origin. That would be inappropriate for a university like HKU."

"My overwhelming feeling about [Zhang Xiang] is, when I was in the same position, all I wanted was to be given a chance. And I think people should give him a chance."
