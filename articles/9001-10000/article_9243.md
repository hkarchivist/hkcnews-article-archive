# I back Paul Lam, Shieh says

**Paul Shieh, SC, former Bar Association chairman, broke his silence over the ongoing rare contested election between two star-studded lists led respectively by incumbent Chairman Paul Lam, SC, for a second term and Philip Dykes, SC. He threw his weight behind Lam, formerly his deputy in Bar. But stressing that the current climate called for plurality and diversity in Bar Council, Shieh said he will pick one or two candidates from Dkyes' list. Below is the full text of his letter he sent to members with minor style changes.**

**Bar Council Election 2018**

I have observed closely the election activities carried out by both sides and the matter as reported and portrayed by the media. I take this opportunity to directly share my message and thoughts with members so that you (if you are interested) can read in full, without the risk of selective or mis-quotation by social and other media.

**The inner cabinet**

No Chairman operates in a vacuum. He works with, and takes advice from, Council members. It may be a little known fact, but to my knowledge (since my involvement in Bar Council affairs from 2007 - 2015), the "inner cabinet" (the two Vice Chairmen, the Honorary Secretary and – in later years – the Deputy Honorary Secretary) have played an important role in guiding and assisting the Chairman. That is why an intending Chairman should make sure that his inner cabinet reflects different values and strengths of the Bar. Needless to say, he should liaise with the inner cabinet and make sure that he has their full support before putting them forward as his cabinet.

The last contested election for Bar Chairman took place in January 2007, between Rimsky Yuen SC and Clive Grossman SC. On that occasion, there was close co-ordination between them as to the Vice-Chairmanship. They both agreed that, whoever was elected as Chairman, the other would serve as Vice Chairman. As to the remaining Vice Chairman post, a joint approach was made to me, and I expressly agreed that I was content to serve as Vice Chairman to both of them. The candidates for Chairmanship and Vice-Chairmanship were presented on this basis.

This year, because no competing candidates for the inner cabinet had been offered (meaning, to state the obvious, that no one had challenged them for the posts), the four candidates for the inner cabinet (who are only on Paul Lam SC's list) will be elected unopposed. Yet as a matter of objective fact (and lest it be overlooked by members), Paul Lam SC has the faith and support of this unchallenged inner cabinet, both in terms of (i) being put forward collectively as part of his list but also (ii) positively and openly writing in support of him. In our highly charged society, the work and views of unsung heroes who work quietly and selflessly (默默耕耘) in the background, but who had good first-hand experience and observations of the candidate in question, are often unfortunately neglected and not accorded sufficient weight.

**Diversity and credibility**

I wish to remind members of what I had said in paragraph 19 of my farewell speech in the Opening of Legal Year in January 2015 (a paragraph which might have been under-reported because of reports on other parts of the same speech): -

"Many have asked, "whose side is the Bar on?" We owe no affiliation to any side. We are independent, not only from the Establishment but also from party political forces irrespective of their leadership or pedigree. Our independence makes our views on Rule of Law all the more valuable and balanced. We are not the "Reserves Team" of political parties who have – for many years – wrongly assumed that they could call upon the Bar to readily rally for their political acts from a "Rule of Law angle". We can criticize the Establishment, as well as those with a "political halo". Sometimes it takes more courage to criticize the latter than the former. I am quite sure that despite what I have unequivocally said about Rule of Law, Judicial Independence, the White Paper and the NPCSC Decision, there are still people who would express their discontent in a high profiled manner, simply because we have not said everything in the way they had wanted us to say, or because we had dared to criticize them. Do we blindly stand for one side, or the other, or do we stand only for the Rule of Law? You'll be the judge"   
 The community of course expects the Bar to speak out on important issues concerning the Rule of Law; more so in these challenging times. It is therefore crucial that the Bar (and the Council) remains, and remains perceived to be, neutral from the Establishment as well as from political forces. The current climate also calls for plurality and diversity in the Council and a Chairman who has the vision to choose such a diverse and pluralistic Council. Such attributes will minimize any "echo-chamber effect" (a well-known phenomenon where like-minded people – however educated and professional – group together (whether in person or online) and share and unwittingly mutually reinforce one type of view or perspective with little regard to a whole wide world of equally legitimate perspectives on how certain issues should be handled).

Plurality and diversity also helps counter so-called "selection bias" (the word "bias" is used without any nefarious or pejorative connotation here – it just reflects inevitable and subconscious human nature) in the Bar Council when deciding upon what topics to comment on and how. An explanation and example of selection bias is given by a recent empirical study by the University of Chicago Law School as follows:-

"[a liberal] professor might search out research problems where it happens to be the case that the correct outcome is liberal. We call this phenomenon "selection bias." Imagine, for example, that court #1 has wrongly interpreted statute A in a liberal direction, and court #2 has wrongly interpreted unrelated statute B in a conservative direction. A liberal professor might exercise selection bias without engaging in substantive bias by writing an article criticizing court #2 while ignoring court #1."

This is something that the Bar Council should avoid, lest it be accused of double standards (something I also alluded to in my speech in January 2015).

The Rule of Law is inherently a liberal concept, closely linked with a democratic political system. It is therefore unsurprising that the Bar's views of the Rule of Law are sometimes in line with the views of politicians with a conviction and commitment to the democratic cause. However, such persons could themselves overstep the mark and from time to time and be guilty of conduct which undermines the Rule of Law. It is in situations like these that it becomes all the more important for a pluralistic Bar Council to be able to marshal the moral courage to speak out. The Bar Council must not be perceived to be like Arsene Wenger who, when confronted with infractions of his own team (or allies), only answer "I didn't see that".

For those who are already deeply committed to a certain belief or cause, they need little or no persuasion from the Bar. They await the Bar to speak out and applaud, and then perhaps "like" and share with like-minded friends. Yet the persons who most require persuasion and explanation are in fact (i) those who are not already "like-minded" (including those in power politically) and (ii) more importantly, members of the lay public who are uninformed (but who are interested to know). The last thing I want to see is for the Bar to be perceived as affiliated with party-political forces and that it frequently or even presumptively advocates views that appear to favour only their cause, so that the Bar's views (however well founded) are met or denigrated with a dismissive or rhetorical: "well, you would predictably say that, wouldn't you?"

I have used the word "perceived" more than once. In the areas where the Bar's views are likely to be valued namely Rule of Law and public law, perception is all important – perhaps more important than whether one is in fact a member of any political party. The Bar's views in these areas will often be scrutinized in the political arena (with people ready to attack the Bar as being partisan) and it is often said that in politics, perception is more important than truth. And when the Bar seeks to engage, inform and persuade the lay public, it is important that the Bar is not perceived to be doing anyone's bidding so as to maintain its credibility and authority. The point is often not just about a perception of one individual – it is the collective perception that matters.

**Where do we go from here?**

I bear in mind all the above points. Further, Paul Lam SC served as my Vice Chairman (with Selwyn Yu SC) in my final term as Chairman. I have observed his calm, fair, meticulous, well-rounded and painstaking approach and care towards all aspects of Bar Council work – not only on what might be called the "politically charged" matters concerning the Rule of Law but on matters such as members’ welfare, professional development and the Bar’s international relationship. Nothing that I had observed as an external observer since I stepped down and ceased my involvement in Bar Council matters had changed my views and judgment of Paul. He will have my vote.

As for the other contested seats, there is one point which neither side may want to bring out openly and, lest it be overlooked by members, I would bring out here: - there is no rule that states that one must go "all in" for one list or another. Seeing that there is a section of members who desire more presence on the Bar Council of voices from certain angles and specializations, I will vote for most candidates on Paul Lam SC's list but will vote for one – and not more than two – from Phil's list who are well recognized experts in their fields so that there is a further reinforcement of expertise. Further than that I would not go, not only for the reasons I mentioned earlier but also because it would run the risk of upsetting what must have been a carefully thought out equilibrium and "spread" of elected members across different spectrum of outlook, seniority, areas of expertise and Bar Council service specializations.

Yours,   
 Paul Shieh SC   
 Chairman 2013 to 2015
