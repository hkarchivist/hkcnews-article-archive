# The Sword of Damocles has Dropped

**A year-end poem highlighting the plight of Hongkongers as the Communist Party ups the ante in throttling One Country, Two Systems…**

The sword of Damocles has dropped,   
 As our crown jewel is being robbed;   
 "One country, two systems" is no more:   
 Proletarian dictatorship is crushing through the door.

All hail the pitch-black sun at noon;   
 The wheel of fortune has gone out of tune.   
 Big brother has bared his fangs:   
 "Whatever I say is law, thanks!"

While the Brits have long kowtowed,   
 And Mad Donald praises Emperor Xi out loud;   
 Hongkongers who don't want to be slaves   
 Should call out those bloody knaves….

Our top officials who grew up drinking local water   
 Have delivered the SAR's freedom on a platter:   
 In the name of fealty to the northern authorities –   
 In reality for rich spoils and assorted briberies.

There is a special place in hell   
 For traitors whose conscience is an easy sell:   
 They've testified that deer are horses;   
 They'd steal and kill for the big bosses.

Millions are now left in the lurch:   
 Praying for a miracle in a beleaguered church.   
 Five thousand years of culture is at stake:   
 The Party has dressed up the nasty and the fake.

So that was the year that was:   
 Never thought Hong Kong would be so star-crossed.   
 But we shall put up a ferocious fight,   
 Firmly believing that might can never make right!

If Hong Kong independence is a bridge too far;   
 Independence of mind is why we are what we are.   
 Science and democracy we shall never forsake,   
 As fraud and sophistry will never make the grade!
