# No legal basis for disqualifying Yiu or Chow

***Editor's note: In responding to the questions from CitizenNews, Professor Johannes M M Chan SC provides the following answers.***

My view is that there is no legal basis for disqualifying [Edward] Yiu or [Agnes] Chow:

1. Eligibility to stand as a candidate is governed by section 39 of the LegCo Ordinance. None of the provisions there is applicable. S39(1)(f), which is allegedly relied upon, is not a free standing provision but relies on other law. So the only legal basis has to be the Basic Law, the National People's Congress Standing Committee Interpretation [on Article 104], the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance, or the judgment of Au J [of the Court of First Instance on the four legislators in July 2017].

2. Article 104 of the Basic Law said that a public officer must take the oath "when assuming office". This phrase must refer to the office that a candidate assumes upon being elected, not an office that he is going to contest and assume in future, as the duty to take oath does not arise until one is elected.

3. This is fortified by section 19 of the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance, under which a candidate should take the oath as soon as possible after "the commencement of his term of office". That is, the taking of oath is required after one has commenced his office and is related to that very office.

4. Yiu's term of office commenced on 1 October 2016 as per Gazette Notice dated 12 July 2016. His duty to take oath arose from assuming that office.

5. He failed to take the oath on 12 Oct 2016. Subsequent disqualification proceedings confirmed that his disqualification took effect on 12 Oct 2016. Au J's judgment is about that office and has nothing to do with any future office.

6. The NPCSC interpretation said an oath taker is disqualified forthwith "from assuming the public office" specified in the article. The disqualification is specifically referring to the "assumption" of the public office, and the public office has to mean the very office that the oath taker was returned on that particular occasion under which the duty to take oath arose. It could not mean a future office or a bar from contesting for a future seat.

7. At best, the NPCSC interpretation is silent as to whether a disqualified legislator can take part in a by-election.

8. One would then look at section 21 of the Oaths and Declarations Ordinance. The consequence of noncompliance is that if he has already entered on his office, he has to "vacate the office". This again points to vacation of the very office that he has already assumed, not to any future office. Likewise, if he has not entered on his office, he shall be "disqualified from entering it." This again clearly suggests that the office is the one he has entered pursuant to s19, not any future office.

9. This conclusion is further strengthened by Article 26 of the Basic Law, which protects the right to stand for election. This includes a right not to be prevented from taking office and any restriction on this right has to be expressly provided for and subject to the proportionality test.

10. Any bar from taking part in election, e.g., due to conviction of criminal offence or bar from taking part in a by election upon resignation from office are expressly provided for in legislation and are for a short duration only.

11. In the absence of express provisions either in the legislation or in the NPCSC interpretation, one should be slow to draw any conclusion that the constitutional right to stand for election should be curtailed. This is particularly so when the existing provisions point to a conclusion that the disqualification is about the existing office and not future assumption of office, and that taking or failing to take an oath is something which can easily be rectified in the future assumption of office. There is nothing to show that Yiu is unable to take the oath again.

A bar that goes beyond the existing office merely on the ground of failure to take an oath when assuming that office with nothing to suggest that the candidate is unwilling or unable to take the oath if he were elected again is a disproportionate restriction on the right to stand for election.

12. There is even weaker reason to disqualify Chow. She has not taken any oath and has not been disqualified. The only reason is her membership in a group. This is not a ground for disqualifying a candidate. Nathan Law belongs to the same group and was not disqualified from contesting the LegCo seat last time. Disqualification on the ground of association to a society or speculation of failure to take an oath is a disproportionate restriction of one's right to stand for election.
