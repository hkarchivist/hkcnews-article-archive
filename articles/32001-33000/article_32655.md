# Herd immunity, what a pity....

Back in the old days, bet most youngsters spent their summer break with beer pongs, playing the game charades, or throwing small missiles/darts day & night.

What about last summer break? Need me to say? Being bullied, insulted, beaten & harassed by green objects.

What about this summer break? Even worse - there is an add-on: pandemic.

Look, if we have a reasonable government, we may get through this tough time in a relatively easy way; wiping out political reason, shall we take a look at how Taiwan beat the coronavirus?

With nearly 24 million citizens, Taiwan has had around 450 cases and less than 10 deaths. Praise it on a plan which has been sitting there for years - quarantines, contact tracing, surgical masks etc.

Based on an interview with a Taiwanese citizen, Miss Chou, it’s not arguable that the Taiwanese government is doing pretty well as in quarantine. Miss Chou flew to Taiwan from the US, she’s requested the be quarantined for 2 weeks - with government’s subsidy. Miss Chou checked into a hotel, where food would be delivered to her doorstep. Representative of local district’s office called Miss Chou several times a day to check on her - in a nice tone.

Now, take a look at how the Hong Kong government deal with this: people arrived at the Hong Kong airport, left samples for coronavirus tests, and they’re good to go - well, the government would give them hand-bands, to identify that these people have not yet past the 14-days’ quarantine-period. Ha! hand-band..... it’s proven that those hand-bands could be removed without any hiccup, funny...

On the paper, you might have read that a woman, who had been informed that she’s caught the virus, went out for daily necessities before she checked into hospital. Ah.... she spent around 2 hours on her shopping, imagine how many people might have caught the virus from her....

Did you read on paper that an infected person sneaked out from the Tseung Kwan O hospital? Though the hospital was alarmed on such, it’s not until the infected person went back to the hospital that he’s “arrested”. Let’s see how many people might have caught the virus from him....

Maybe I am mentally retarded, I still don’t understand why international ship & airline crews, businesspeople, & officials travelling to & from the Mainland China could be exempted from the mandatory quarantine.... it’s already too late when the government cancelled this exemption, a disaster is disaster, thanks to our beloved government.

Is it that hard to close the border? Well, I am not intelligent enough to say anything....

Shall we say YES to herd immunity? What a pity.......
