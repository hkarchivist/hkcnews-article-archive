# Social Unrest... some people just can’t care less...

By Ginger bread

Time flies, time really flies... we just witnessed the one year anniversary of the Yuen Long violence - a mob attacked protesters & passengers at Yuen Long MTR station.

Look, if you expect any of the attackers will be arrested, dream on.... let’s face the reality, get real...

Don’t you think so?

With an excuse of social gathering regulations, a so-called reason of security law, green objects can give you a ticket or even arrest you even though you are just walking along the street. You reckon I am exaggerating? Well, read your newspaper: by means of newspaper, I mean newspaper, NOT paper that is brushed up with fake, non-sense lies.

Well done Carrie Lam! With the social gathering regulations, people who went to Yoho Mall in Yuen Long to mark the anniversary of the violence were issued tickets. “We came in groups of four,” said one of the victims. “But when we arrived, the police ushered us together and then claimed we had breached the social-gathering regulations.” Hey victim, you are not alone, at least 96 people were issued tickets. Well, it’s an income to the government afterall...

Splendid green objects! You guys know how to utilise security law - A man was hand-cuffed and being taken away from the mall, being accused of displaying a placard reading “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times.”

Did I mention green objects shooting pepper balls within a short distance? As in short, I mean short, shorter than the length of your palm.

Hmm... out of 30,000 green objects, 1 of them was stabbed during operation, and the government made a big deal out of it; what about those innocent victims who were hurt & abused during social activities? This government...

Lest we forget...
