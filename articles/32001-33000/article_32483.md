# Eat-in ban is way too tight, something is absolutely not right.

The city’s coronavirus outbreak shows no sign of abating… have you ever wondered what our beloved government would do to rescue Hong Kong residents? Let’s see.. Oh, here we go: instead of closing the loopholes of anti-coronavirus measures – e.g. prohibiting high risk virus carriers entering the border, our fearless government forced a ridiculous eat-in ban: eat-in services banned at all eateries – hmm, nearly all, some privileged ones can eat-in at eatery inside the Central Government Complex of HKSAR.

Social media were speedily swamped by photos of people filling up their stomachs on the street under the flaming sun, some of the people had to eat in the rain, with no roof above their heads…

Mind you, with the new measures in place, no more than 2 people can “gather” together: what a joke, during the first day of the new measures came in place, the sky “cried” a bit, tear-drops of the sky gave those poor outdoor “patrons” no choice but dashing to public roofed-footbridges to avoid getting soaked. Guess what happened? Green objects yelled at them right away: new social-distancing rule in place! No more than 2 people in one group! Stay further! Ah…….

Look, to outdoor workers, lunch-break is the ONLY time for them to cool off; have you ever worked outdoor under the scorching sun for the whole day? With no cool-down break, it’s damn lucky that those workers don’t get heatstroke.

Well, let’s give our government an excuse: those people who came up with this eat-in ban, are all insulated from the reality; they kill time in their comfortable air-conditioned offices, funded by tax-payers – a gentle reminder: those victims who were forced to eat on the street are also tax-payers – how can we expect those people would understand the city’s eating habits and impact against outdoor workers?

“If I can choose, I’d rather die.”, said one of the soaked victims – soaked, not because of the rain, it’s because of his sweat. “I am eating dust, I smell exhaust; I am starving, but I don’t have appetite; I am forcing myself to eat, I need energy to work, I need to feed my family.”

The virus has a come-back lately, why? It’s come-back is brought to us by tens of thousands of people who were exempted from a mandatory quarantine imposed on most arrivals. They included international ship & airline crews, businesspeople, and officials travelling to and from the mainland China.

Why on earth our government doesn’t do something about that? Why imposed that rubbish eat-in ban? Can you imagine how many people & eateries are impacted?

This non-sense eat-in ban is now reversed, at least, outdoor workers can cool down a bit during lunch break while enjoying luncheons at air-conditioned eateries, blue collar workers don’t need to eat inside public lavatories, non-office employees don’t have to eat on pavements.

Question: Where is the apology from our government?
