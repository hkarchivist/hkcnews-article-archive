律政司司長鄭若驊在記者會上證實，刑事檢控專員梁卓然已請辭，但沒有進一步解釋請辭原因。梁卓然在內部電郵表示，知道最近部分人對於突然被調去處理有關國安法案件，對當中的不確定性感到擔憂，又在電郵指，「對於國安法的案件，我沒有資訊可以給你們，因為我沒有被要求在有關事項中提供協助及參與。」以下為梁卓然發出的內部電郵全文：

Dear Colleagues

Earlier this week I have tendered my resignation and will be stepping down as DPP and leaving the civil service on 31 December 2020, allowing ample time for a smooth transition and handover.

It is most unfortunate that I do not see eye to eye with the SJ on the running of PD, and the situation has not improved with the passage of time. This is not conducive to the smooth operation of PD and certainly not something that I, as a prosecutor serving the Division for 25 years and the current head, would like to see. It will be best for the SJ and the Division to have a new DPP so that new ideas and visions can be brought in.

I enjoy every single day working in PD, particularly the time in court. It has been my honour and pleasure to have worked with you over the years, during which I have gained invaluable experience, fond memories and great friendships.

Being a prosecutor is a difficult but honourable job. We never strive to get a conviction. Rather, we ensure that the charges laid are a proper reflection of the criminality on the available evidence, proper disclosure has been made, the defendant has a fair trial and finally the sentence passed is within range.

This requires a constant reminder to ourselves that we are ministers of justice, something that we should be proud of and feel privileged. Every prosecutorial decision that you make, every trial or appeal that you conduct, is constantly measured by all the other stakeholders of the criminal justice system to see if we have achieved and maintained the high standards required of a fair and competent prosecutor.

To this end, I am proud to inform you that I have received many positive feedbacks from judges of your performances. Judges wrote in not because of the verdict, one way or the other. Rather, they wrote in stating he/she was impressed with the fair and measured way in which you conducted the prosecution, or in appeal cases, the fairness and the conciseness of your submissions and the most helpful assistance that you have provided the court with.

Recently, I understand a number of you are concerned about the uncertainty of a sudden posting to another division or the division/unit handling National Security Cases. As to the former, the inter divisional transfer scheme has been in place to cater for operational needs and career development of counsel and in so far as practicable, counsel will be given sufficient notice of the intended transfer. As to National Security Cases, I do not have information for you as my assistance and participation in those matters have not been required.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your hard work and support in the past and I am sure you will continue with your good work in support of the SJ and the new DPP.

I wish each of you and your family good health despite the difficult epidemic situation we are having in Hong Kong. Take care.

Best regards,

David
