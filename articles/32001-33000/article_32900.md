Throughout the weekend, majority of Hong Kong people were celebrating: the Trump administration imposed economic sanctions on 11 current and former Chinese officials last Friday; I could hardly get myself a bottle of champagne – why champagne but not beer? Well, you know why….

Sanction? What is it about?

Under the sanctions, the US-based assets of those officials are blocked and Americans and businesses are generally prohibited from dealing with them.

How did those 11 people respond? Some of them said they couldn’t care more, the HKSAR government said the sanctions are [“Shameless and Despicable”](https://web.archive.org/web/20200918080141/https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202008/08/P2020080800317.htm) .

Guess how our beloved government reacted? Bingo! The usual way, retaliate in a childish way!

Don’t tell me you haven’t heard of Apple Daily – as per a Reuters Institute poll conducted in Year 2019, this paper and its news web site were the second most used in Hong Kong. As per a survey conducted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, this paper was the third most trusted paid newspaper in Year 2019. Founder of Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon, was arrested on Monday 10th August 2020 – 2 days after the U.S. sanctions were imposed.

So, what excuse did our government use this time? Not surprisingly, for collusion with a foreign country, uttering seditious words and conspiracy to defraud. Jimmy’s sons were also arrested, former student activist, Agnes Chow, was detained.

Around 200 green objects had a raid at Apple Daily premises that lasted for nearly 10 hours. Ah….. 200 green objects…. Didn’t our government say the HK Police Force didn’t have sufficient resources and hence couldn’t help on the 21st July 2019 Yuen Long attack? NO green object went to the scene, not even a single one. Remember Teeth Dog/Goosehead Yip Kai Foon? Yip was the first person to have used an AK-47 during an armed-robbery in Hong Kong, does anybody remember how many green object were assigned during the operation? (He was found with a machine gun, a pistol, and 1.8 kg of explosives when he was captured.)

Ok, what does the arrest of Jimmy Lai mean? The arrest marked the end of Media Freedom…..

Hong Kong people showed support against Jimmy by pushing up the stocks price of Next Digital (Apple Daily is part of Next Digital), buying ALL hardcopies of Apple Daily, and of course, voicing out on different social media platforms.

Our beloved government, do you hear the people sing?

Well, probably not, this arrest operation is just like a kid crying out loud to his mum, “hey mum, bro took my lollies!”
