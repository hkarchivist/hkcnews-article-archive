# The second tsunami

*By Siddharth Sridhar, clinical assistant professor from the Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong*

COVID-19 is back again. We are seeing a lot more local cases than imported cases in the the current COVID-19 wave (unlike in March). Lack of identified source for many of the cases and wide spread of cases across Hong Kong means that there are many outbreaks ongoing simultaneously throughout the territory. Putting out all these fires by traditional methods will be extremely difficult. Bold, fast & innovative steps are going to be required.

Some measures that will have to be considered by individuals and the government:

1. Opening windows and wearing masks in taxis/ minibuses should be mandatory. Payment in taxis MUST be cashless, the virus survives well on coins and notes (especially the 'polymer' $10 bill).

2. Stop flights from high-risk areas with low testing rates/ high COVID-19 rates. Reserve limited quarantine facilities for contact cases of the local outbreak. Also, home quarantine in Hong Kong is not effective because of cramped living quarters and possibility of virus spillover to neighbouring flats via pipes.

3. Test EVERYONE in affected districts over a 5-day period. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infected individuals account for a lot of COVID-19 transmission. Mass testing is simply the only way to identify asymptomatic carriers, isolate them and keep their contacts under close observation. Collection of posterior throat saliva (by people themselves) improves logistics. Sample pooling can be considered to cut costs and lab run-time.

4. We urgently need a dedicated facility to care for mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, with urgent transfer service to acute hospitals in case of clinical deterioration. Hospitals should be reserved for moderate-severe COVID-19 patients to prevent overloading of the Hospital Authority.

5. Physical distancing, avoiding large gatherings, face coverage in public areas remain as important as ever.

Difficult times coming ahead.   
 Stay safe, stay rational, stay compassionate.
