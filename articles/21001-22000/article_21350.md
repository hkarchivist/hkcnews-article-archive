# 【記者會語錄】6.12鎮壓　林鄭：警務人員執法理所當然、天公地義

6月12日 (周三）金鐘大衝突中，警方將事件定性為暴動。行政長官林鄭月娥，在昨日的記者會上被問到警方的行動，以及會否收回暴動的定性，她稱：「警務人員的執法是理所當然、是天公地義，是他們每一位加入香港警務處的使命。」她說，覺得警員是克制、負責任，盡量以維持大局的態度工作，她贊成亦同意暴動定性。被問到會否成立獨立委員會檢討及追究責任，林鄭沒有回應。

美國CBS電視台記者，在記者會上向林鄭提到，周三當天他在示威現場，看到警方使用過分武力，似乎警方是對準示威者的頭部和軀體。記者詢問林鄭，民間有人希望她不將示威者稱為暴徒、希望釋放被捕人士，她會否做到。林鄭表示，她作為特首不能介入執法機關運作，又指當天有很多人向警方掟磚、車輛被阻塞、她一名主要官員被困路上多個小時。

**林鄭回應警方6.12在金鐘行動：**

「我想絕大部分香港市民都可以在新聞報道，看到發生了有些不是所謂和平表達意見，是用了一些有殺傷力的武器襲擊警務人員，所以警務人員的執法是理所當然、是天公地義，是他們每一位加入香港警務處的使命。你不能夠要求因為行政長官自己工作做得不好，就連這些執法人員努力維持治安的工作都要被抹黑，我做不到。」

「在現場如何去處理在電光火石之間可能生命受到威脅或帶來更大、難以控制的場面的情況，一定要交回給執法人員；當然他們不是隨便執法，每一位警務人員在甚麼情況下可以採取甚麼行動，我知道警務處是有指引，亦有足夠訓練給他們。我覺得警務人員是克制、負責任，是盡量以維持大局的態度來工作。」

「前線警務同事怎樣處理及怎樣形容、定性，這都是警務處的責任。我是贊成亦是同意這種說法，我在星期三的聲明亦說了，這是行政長官很清晰的說法。」

回應美國CBS記者：「Hong Kong is a very lawful society. I have just mentioned in response to another question that even as the Chief Executive (CE), I have to act lawfully. So I cannot override the law enforcement bodies to decide who should be arrested, who should be released - that is totally unlawful. And if I were to do this, I don't think many people or investors will continue to trust Hong Kong, because the CE could do anything – to arrest somebody or detain somebody or release somebody. So, no way, I’m not going to interfere into the investigations by the law enforcement bodies and also the prosecution and the judicial proceedings – everything has to be done lawfully. Especially for prosecution and judiciary decisions, they are independently discharged as provided for under the Basic Law. As the Chief Executive I cannot breach the law, let alone the Basic Law, which is such an important constitutional document.

On your reference to the use of force, I think everybody who watched the TV news on that day will notice that the Police were doing defensive protection of the Legislative Council Building. What you have been told by the Commissioner of the Police is some – I wouldn't say all, definitely not all, because we are talking about 40 000 people maybe – some of protesters were quite violent. If you have looked at some of the weapons that the Police had seized, they were not the sort of equipment that one would deploy in a peaceful protest or a peaceful assembly on a social issue. Have you looked at the bricks? Large numbers of bricks, throwing at the Police. Have you looked at some of the cars deliberately being placed in the middle of the road to obstruct traffic? Did you know that one of my Principal Officials was sort of detained for several hours on a road because of the blockade? So I hope that you can take everything into consideration before you come to a conclusion of what the incident was on Wednesday.」
