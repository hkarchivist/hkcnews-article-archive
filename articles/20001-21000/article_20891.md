# 【引渡修例】英加兩國聯合聲明：對權利自由有負面影響

英國和加拿大兩國政府發表聯合聲明，關注香港特區政府修訂《逃犯條例》。聲明由英國外相侯俊偉、加拿大外交部長方慧蘭聯名發出，指修例明顯在香港引起爭議，尤其關注可以引渡到中國大陸。兩國關注修例對在香港的大量英國和加拿大公民，造成潛在影響，並會影響營商信心及香港的國際聲譽。修例的建議對《中英聯合聲明》訂明的權利和自由，產生負面影響。

兩國聲明強調，香港的引渡安排應符合一國兩制、尊重香港的高度自治，指兩國在與香港政府的對話中，明確表達了有關意見。修例內容需要受到最嚴格的監察，包括立法會。兩國促請香港政府，與本地及國際的團體充份溝通， 以確保他們的關注得到充分考慮，並預留時間考慮其他方案和保障措施。

**The UK and Canada have issued a joint statement about concerns for their citizens in light of proposed changes to extradition laws in Hong Kong.**

Joint statement by Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland:

"We have been following the proposals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to amend the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance. It is clear that the proposals have generated significant debate in Hong Kong, in particular in relation to removing the territorial restrictions on extradition to mainland China.

"We are concerned about the potential effect of these proposals on the large number of UK and Canadian citizens in Hong Kong, on business confidence and on Hong Kong’s international reputation. Furthermore, we believe that there is a risk that the proposals could impact negatively on the rights and freedoms set down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. It is vital that extradition arrangements in Hong Kong are in line with ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and fully respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. We have made these views clear in our respective conversations with the Hong Kong Government.

"It is important that these proposals are subject to the highest levels of scrutiny, including in the Legislative Council. We urge the Hong Kong Government to engage meaningfully with Hong Kong’s broad range of local and international stakeholders in order to ensure their concerns are fully considered. We believe that the Hong Kong Government should allow time to give proper consideration of all alternative options and safeguards."
