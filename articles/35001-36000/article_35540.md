**A Chinese translation of the headline by the author：今年的光棍日　我做這件事**

It’s 11th November, the 11th day of the 11th month of the year. In the mainland China, it’s regarded as The Singles Day, or Double 11 – originally called Bachelors’ Day. What’s so special about it? It’s an unofficial shopping day which celebrates people who are not in relationships.

On Singles Day, shoppers can buy almost everything with steep discounts; as in almost everything, it means things like tooth-picks, toilet-rolls, handbags, mobile phones, diamonds, even apartments…

Sounds unbelievable? Anything is possible…. Look at today’s Hong Kong Stocks market, didn’t you see nearly all of the growth stocks had a “price-slash”? LOL….

Hey, it’s also [Remembrance Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126043450/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day) （ [國殤紀念日](https://web.archive.org/web/20201126043450/https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/國殤紀念日) ） – a memorial day to be observed since the end of the First World War, a day to remember all those who fought & died in the line of duty to keep us free.

What do I normally do on this day? Well, my typical routine: drag myself out of the sack before dawn, spend an hour or so walking along the beach, feel the breeze on my face. Close my eyes, observe a few minutes’ silence – a gesture of remembering the heroes/heroines. After a quick bite, dash to the city and fulfil my shopping-list…

#### This year, I did nothing, apart from mourning for Hong Kong.

Quoting from HKFP: “The Hong Kong government has disqualified four pro-democracy lawmakers after Beijing’s top legislative body passed a resolution to oust legislators who promote or support Hong Kong independence, appeal to foreign governments to “interfere,” refuse to accept China’s rule over the city or endanger national security.”

What did you do today?
