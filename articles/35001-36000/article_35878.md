On 10th November, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) passed a decision to formulate the framework arrangement involving the disqualification of Hong Kong legislators. According to such decision, HKSAR government immediately disqualified four pan-democratic legislators. Much attention has been paid to the NPCSCS’s controversial decision, as to whether it has executed procedural justice, as well as the impact it is to bring on the parliamentary politics resulting from the mass resignation of opposition lawmakers in the aftermath of disqualification.   
   
 While these issues have far-reaching implications, another noteworthy aspect of this NPCSC decision is the legal basis that the NPCSC has invoked. This decision cites a large number of legal documents, including three laws (the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong Basic Law, and the Hong Kong national security Law), two decisions made by the NPC and the NPCSC (namely “Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanism for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to Safeguard National Security" and "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Continuing Discharge of Duties by the Sixth Term Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region"), and a document of NPCSC’s interpretation (the decision on Article 104 of the Basic Law in 2016).

### The NPCSC invokes the P.R.C. Constitution's "Fundamental Rights and Duties of the Citizens" provision for the first time.

Constitutional provisions invoked in past NPCSC decisions on Hong Kong were mainly related to the powers and functions of the NPC and the NPCSC, such as Article 62 and 67 of the Constitution. This decision, however, invokes Article 52 ("Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall have the obligation to safeguard national unity and the solidarity of all the country’s ethnic groups.") and Article 54 ("Citizens of the People’s Republic of China shall have the obligation to safeguard the security, honor and interests of the motherland; they must not behave in any way that endangers the motherland’s security, honor or interests.") of the Constitution for the first time. These two articles are from Chapter II of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights and Obligations of Citizens). The problem is the meaning behind the quoted articles: Does it mean that these two articles of the Constitution are directly applicable to Hong Kong?

### How the Constitution applies to Hong Kong

Since the drafting of the Basic Law, there has been much discussion among Mainland and local legal scholars as to whether and how the Constitution of the People's Republic of China should apply to Hong Kong. In the absence of a unanimous conclusion, a general statement has been made that the Constitution of the People's Republic of China applies "as a whole" to Hong Kong. The rationale behind this statement is that China is a unitary state, that there can be only one constitution for the whole country, that no local administrative region or autonomous region can have a legal document labeled "Constitution", and that the Constitution itself does not have a single article that limits its scope of validity, so that its entirely covers the entire Chinese territory, including Hong Kong.   
   
 But it is clear that under the principle of "one country, two systems," Hong Kong does not practice the socialist system and policies of the Mainland. The scholars naturally move to another level of discussion: the issues of the applicability of individual constitutional provisions in Hong Kong. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the public discussed which constitutional provisions should be applied to Hong Kong, whether they should be listed, and even suggested adding to Article 11(1) of the Basic Law "The other provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (i.e., other than Article 31) shall not be applied to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region". It was rejected because the then Drafting Committee considered that the Constitution was the supreme law of the land and therefore it was impossible to stipulate in the Basic Law which constitutional provisions shall apply to Hong Kong.   
   
 In the Constitution, Articles 31 and 62(14) are directly related to the system of the HKSAR, and some of the constitutional provisions also have effect in the HKSAR, especially those related to the organs of state power. In other words, the definitions and functions of the People's Republic of China, the NPCSC, the State Council, etc. mentioned in the Basic Law are not given detailed annotations, and they must be defined by the Constitution. However, the decisions of NPCSC in recent years (e.g. the decision on implementing co-location arrangement) have led to a clear difference of opinion among scholars: whether NPCSC can only exercise its power over Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law, or whether the way it exercises its power over Hong Kong is not limited to the Basic Law, but also based on the Constitution.

### Should the constitutional rights and obligations be applied to Hong Kong?

As for the applicability of the constitutional rights and duties of Chinese citizens in Hong Kong, there has not been much controversy in the past, because under “one country, two systems”, due to differences in legal systems and ideologies, there is a clear difference between the Constitution and the Basic Law in terms of rights and duties: The Basic Law provides for a wide range of rights and freedoms, such as freedom of movement, which are broader than the Chinese citizens’ positive duties stated in chapter II of the Constitution. The vast majority of the provisions in Chapter III of the Basic Law (Fundamental Rights and Duties of the Residents) are designed to protect the rights of Hong Kong residents, except for Article 42, which deals with duties: Hong Kong residents and other persons in Hong Kong shall have the obligation to abide by the laws in force in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.   
   
 As for the constitutional provisions on the rights and duties of Chinese citizens, they can be divided into several categories, most of which should not apply to Hong Kong.   
   
 (1) The rights mentioned in both the Constitution and the Basic Law (e.g. the right to vote and the right to stand for election) shall follow the Basic Law.   
 (2) Provisions that are clearly related to the socialist system and policies (Articles 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49) shall not apply to Hong Kong.   
 (3) The obligations concerning military service and taxation should not apply to Hong Kong.   
   
 Most of the requirements of Article 53 should also not be applied to Hong Kong, not only because Article 53 is regulated by the socialist system ("observe discipline in the workplace"), but also because "Citizens of the People’s Republic of China must abide by the Constitution and the law" is not consistent with the principle of "one country, two systems”.

### The impact of NPCSC's "decision": positive duties of public officials

After the above-mentioned provisions that are clearly not applicable to Hong Kong, only Articles 52 and 54 remain in Chapter 2, which are also the provisions cited in this NPCSC decision. These two articles not only require Chinese citizens not to secede from the country and not to endanger national security, but also include the obligation to actively and positively protect national unity, security, honor, and interests. Article 6 of the National Security Law already contains a similar provision: "It is the common responsibility of all the people of China, including the people of Hong Kong, to safeguard the sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity of the People’s Republic of China.” Why does NPCSC find it so necessary to invoke these two articles from the Constitution when defining the legal requirements and conditions for the qualifications of LegCo members? This NPCSC decision may affect the applicability of individual constitutional provisions in Hong Kong, but it has not been adequately addressed and discussed. Apart from Articles 52 and 54, what other articles of the Constitution regarding the rights and obligations will be applied in the future to the Chinese citizens who are residents of Hong Kong?   
   
 Another concern is the positive duties of public officials. By citing these two articles, does the NPCSC's decision mean that LegCo members (including the so-called "opposition"), in addition to not engaging in the four types of behavior described in the decision, are also required to assume some positive duties to protect national unity and security? As LegCo members in Hong Kong, how should they fulfill these obligations? The Basic Law allows permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region who are not of Chinese nationality to be elected as Members of the LegCo, provided that they do not account for more than 20% of the total membership of the Council. If non-Chinese nationals are elected to the LegCo in the future, how will these two articles on the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens apply to these legislators?   
   
 In recent years, Beijing's emphasis on "according to the law" has been gradually extended from acting in accordance with the Basic Law to acting in accordance with both the Constitution and the Basic Law, while the HKSAR government has further emphasized the importance of constitutional education. In the past, we used to think that "everything should be done in accordance with the Basic Law", but with the central government's emphasis on comprehensive governance, the Constitution has gradually entered the discussion of "one country, two systems", and with the regularization of the "decision"  making of the NPCSC, it has been increasingly applied in practice. What is the relationship between the Constitution and the Basic Law? What role will the Constitution play in the governance of Hong Kong? Does this NPCSC decision mean that more constitutional provisions will be directly applicable to Hong Kong? How this would bring about greater change in the "one country, two systems" is another question worth examining, in addition to the "qualifications" debate.
