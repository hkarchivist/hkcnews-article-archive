# The Truth But Not The Truth on June 9

**By a Hong Konger**

On 9 June 2020, the date that marked the first anniversary of a year-long unsettled Hong Kong protest, I feel the urge to say......

We have peaceful protests across the territory, but not looting, not a single store of luxurious brands or electronic appliances was robbed during the protests.

We do not chant "Black Lives Matter" but we know "Young Lives Matter" when we see "young people in black clothing" is the reason for being interrogated, attacked or caught by the heavily armed police.

We have had shops or public facilities vandalised, but as a response to the conglomerates or authorities behind them in support of the police violence. One business founder has been famously quoted as saying she isn't mind losing two generations of young people.

We do not have George Floyd, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown or Eric Garner, but we have mysterious deaths of the 15 years old Chan Yin Lam and the 22 years old, University of Science and Technology's final year student, Chow Tsz Lok, plus more than 2500 corpses in black clothing whose names are not known and their cases were concluded as 'dead body found without suspicion' by the police on the scenes.

We do not have a KKK leader charged for allegedly driving his car into the protesters, but we have a taxi driver coming out free and being awarded tens of thousand HK dollars on the other day for driving his taxi into a group of peaceful protesters causing severely bodily harm to a female marcher.

We, millions of Hong Kongers, have taken to the streets to voice our concern over injustice, but we keep seeing police officers kneeling on the necks or the heads of our young people, including girls in school uniform.

We have seen police kneeing on the protesters's necks numerous times, but the disrespectful and uncivilised practice continues without a call from the authorities for stopping the use of the "carotid restraint".

We have seen the silver-hair elderly, male or female, and pastors in casual wear being kicked or pushed to the ground while begging for mercy from the police, but we haven't had a single apology from the force.

We have seen vividly police violence on videos, but none of these police officers showed their identities from their heavily armed armours covering them from head to toes.

We want to see a reform amid escalating police violence in broad daylight, but not a single police officer has ever got caught or charged while the police chiefs in command, including the one riding his police motorcycle into a group of people, have been hailed as heroes and given job promotions.

We can't breath after seeing countless bloody scenes of the arrested having their heads brutally struck unceasingly by the police batons, but the Government has not ever acknowledged our anger or said our upset feeling should be justified.

We, those who can watch news from independent media, know that police are the reasons for violence, but the Government has quickly come to the conclusion at the very beginning that people in the street protests are rioters and kept rejecting the public's demand for an independent investigation.

We have collected a huge amount of visual images and videos documenting the brutality and scenes of the escalating police violence, but the Government, from the Chief Executive to the police spokesmen, has given us another version of narratives to cover the whole truth.

We have seen initiatives among the people to raise funds for telling the world what have been happening in Hong Kong, but the Government has spent millions of taxpayers' money to shoot a series of official videos to portray a one-sided view about the last year protests. All of them have been broadcast on TV channels and Youtube highlighting violence by protesters without mentioning the role of police in causing and escalating violence.

**An example of such government video:**

We know the truth is that every peaceful protest on the streets or in shopping arcades can turn violent because of the unjustified, excessively use of force by the police but the truth from the Government's publicity tells us police officers are the heroes to restore law and order.

We have volunteers holding civic press conferences to give the public truthworthy information about the current situations, but the Government has blamed the media for spreading fabrication mystifying the Hong Kong public.

...... I can go on and on and on, but we are not allowed.

Very soon, what I am doing here can be classified as offences against national security. Once the national security law has been put forward, by bypassing the hundred years' long legislative procedures of Hong Kong, everyone can be caught for the reason of causing threat to national security on an arbitrary basis.

By then, I can have no more to say because when that time comes, silence is not complicity but protection of one's self and one's family.
