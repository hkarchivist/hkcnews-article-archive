【撰文：在溫哥華讀書的香港兒女】

一群於加拿大溫哥華讀書的國際學生，得知香港警察攻擊香港的大學校園，以及將學生和示威者圍困於理工大學內造成嚴重人道危機，他們自發拍攝了一輯相片，希望香港政府知道"The world is watching"（全世界在看），以及讓所有仍然在抗爭的學生知道，他們的付出正引起世界各地的關注。

英文老師Graeme更出席香港人的集會及簽署postcard，希望加拿大政府可以出手幫助香港。 他說：

> **We are at a moment in history where elites are abusing their power and oppressing regular people, from Chile to Lebanon to Iran to Hong Kong, but the people have had enough. The current situation in Hong Kong may have started with a dispute over extradition to China, but it quickly escalated to armed violence by the police against people expressing their democratic right to free expression, which is a sadly common experience for many around the world. There is nothing new about police violence, but this time they went too far, and the people of Hong Kong have refused to be intimidated. It has been inspiring to see so many people in such a small place stand up to an uncaring government backed by one of the most powerful countries in the world. They're not backing down, and I am proud to stand with them. Solidarity with Hong Kong!**

另一位教師John這樣說：

> **What has happened in Hong Kong is simply unacceptable. The Hong Kong police force has grossly overstepped the laws and regulations that they have been charged with upholding. They must be held accountable and those officers who attacked innocent citizens without provocation must be arrested and tried as the criminals they are!**

意大利學生Romeo力挺香港學生，他說：

> **I'm with the Hong Kong students! Everyone deserves democracy and freedom!!!!**


巴西同學認為香港學生很了不起及勇敢。加拿大港人D 小姐認為，中共及香港政府根本是懼怕了香港這群有前途及政治醒覺的年青人，因為他們喚醒了一直處於溫室中沉睡的港人，正因為這些原因，年青就是罪，年青加再學識，就是極權政府的眼中釘。
