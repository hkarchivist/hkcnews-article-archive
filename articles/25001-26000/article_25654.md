# Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the Slain!

It's Christmas day, are you prepared to celebrate the big day?

Hang on, don't be so optimistic, put the clock back to Year 1941 instead – The day the [Imperial Japanese occupation of Hong Kong](https://web.archive.org/web/20210703064317/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Hong_Kong) began when the then Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, surrendered the British Crown colony of HK to the Empire of Japan – yup, on Christmas Day 1941.

Don't tell me you don't see the links here….. nowadays, cops spray pepper spray to your eyes when they feel like it, even though you're just walking along the street; they fire tear gas bombs as if the air is not polluted enough – neglecting animals/pigeons/any living things in the area; they force citizens to kneel down with hands in the air facing the wall – regardless you haven’t done anything; they bash you as though they’re making mashed potatoes…

Quite a number of victims have already testified in public: being sexually abused & tortured by cops when they're being detained – being detained in a dark & freezing cold locked room. Stupid enough, one of the incidents was captured by CCTV while cops were torturing (sexually, physically & mentally) an 62 year old victim in the hospital: poor him, the tied up old victim couldn't bear the torture and tried to kill himself by banging his head against the bed frame.

Google it, it's not hard for you to see similar incidents happened during the Imperial Japanese occupation of HK back in 1941 – urr, the period didn't end till 3 years & 8 months later.

Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the Slain!   
 Oh what fun it is to fire tear gas bomb to you! Hey!
