 ***A Hong Kong university student studying in UK***

"You guys go back and eat your Life Bread, we go to Shenzhen and have our hot pot!" said a Green Object at the PolyU siege – don't even ask me what is meant by Green Object….

In case you haven't heard of Life Bread: it's manufactured by The Garden Company Limited. Garden is traditionally a Chinese company and supplied bread to the Chinese army during World War II. They also made bread and confectionery more affordable for lower-income earners. It is one of few Hong Kong firms with operations still in Hong Kong.

Why on earth would that Green Object say that kind of thing? So provocative & unprofessional!! They trapped demonstrators in the University – while hundreds of them managed to escape, quite a number of them remained trapped neglected they had tried every possible escape routes: from abseiling off bridges to escaping through sewage tunnel, all failed - curbed at every turn by Green Objects armed with tear gas and rubber bullets – let's assume they're rubber bullets, not real ones.

"Some kids, some little girls, were just lying beside me, we all were suffocating and we just all lay down, begging them [the police] to stop . . . I just heard them laugh," said one of the escaped protestors.

Bet you won't disagree with me if I regard most of the Green Objects nowadays are villain with a badge – and licensed to kill innocence. Protesters being beaten and stomped on heads after being arrested; arrestees being tortured brutally even though numerous people were flashing their cameras; Green Objects tried their very best to suffocate arrestees; a youngster just got gun-shot was swung by a Green Object even though he's already unconscious; a video clearly showed a Green Object tried to crush a protester's leg even though he's arrested & his head was stomped – luckily, a fellow stopped that heartless Green Object: even his teammate couldn't bear with his brutal action…

Hey! Immature Green objects, when will you stop??
