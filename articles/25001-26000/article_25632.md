# Silent Night, Holy Sigh……

**By Ginger bread**   
 ***A Hong Kong university student studying in UK***

Admit it or not, it seems like your whole year has been building up to your annual Christmas Eve night out…. Thousands upon thousands of us meet up with friends and hit up the clubs and bars in a festive attempt to get royally battered. Christmas wouldn't be the same without it.

Not a party animal? No issue, get together with friends/relatives for a banquet, or congregate within churches & cathedrals for Midnight Mass

Hang on!!! NOT for Christmas Eve 2019….

Green objects announced that they would NOT close roads to traffic in the Tsim Sha Tsui district, where large numbers of people traditionally gather on Christmas Eve to view the Christmas lights along a promenade bordering the city's iconic Victoria Harbour. They said, unlike previous years, most roads would not be closed off to traffic in the district, and there wouldn't initially be a large police presence, unless trouble begins to flare.

Well… Green objects fired several rounds of tear gas to disperse protesters whilst many families with children had congregated in the same area to view the Christmas lights along the promenade in the Tsim Sha Tsui East tourist district of Kowloon, the spectacular backdrop of Hong Kong island on the opposite side of the harbour. Hey! Don't blame the Green objects too early, they might want to cloud Christmas Eve with some sort of festive feelings? Yup, who knows if that's what Green objects are going to say when defending themselves at regular Press Conference – bet we're all use to these kinds of non-sense lies/excuses, quite a number of citizens are tired/sick of them, hence not bother watching.

On social media, a video-clip of a citizen waiting for crossing the road was beaten by Green object for no reason – luckily, there's a witness next to him and that it's video'ed.

Brutal Green objects attached citizens even though they haven't done anything, arrested citizens based on no reason, even aimed at a citizen and shoot with plastic bullet at a point-blank range – splashes of blood is the best evidence.

Sarcastic enough, Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor expressed her wish for a safe Christmas for Hong Kong people. "Christmas is a day of joy," Lam said in a 10-second pre-recorded video on social media. "I wish Hongkongers a peaceful, safe and merry Christmas." Peaceful? Safe? Well…..

Silent Night, Holy Sigh……
