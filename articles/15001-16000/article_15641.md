# Against the Current-Past Lives

The new album of Against the Current conveys more mature and sophisticated messages about the meaning of life and the importance of love.

Formed in 2011, this New York trio is an American pop-rock band consisting of lead vocalist Chrissy Costanza, guitarist Dan Gow, and drummer Will Ferri. They first rose to prominence on YouTube by performing some cover songs with other YouTube sensations such as Sam Tsui and Alex Groot. After garnering an enormous extent of popularity, they released their first EP Infinity in 2014 with great success. A year later the band broke through the US with their second EP Gravity gaining a position on Billboard rock music chart. Their work passed with flying colours with critics praising Chrissy's energetic and compelling voice in every song. While their first LP In Our Bones generates a combination of rebellious and captivating directives towards the society as a whole, their sophomore album Past Lives is more about intricate emotional experiences that one has to endure when he or she loses the loved ones. It is an extraordinary record permeated with delicate moments.

Departing from their previous pop rock/pop punk style, the new album incorporates more electronic elements and brings a surprisingly refreshing ambience to listeners. At the first glance, the titles of the songs in this album may create a feeling of a simple heart-breaking love story from the beginning to the end as seen from names such as "P.A.T.T" and "Friendly Reminder". Nevertheless, it is something much more in-depth. Opener "Strangers Again" immediately sets the tone —a melancholic and bitter sweet memory of a relationship that has come to an end. The 11 songs contribute to a major theme about the progress of personal growth and how people should convert the sadness in life into positive impetus to grow stronger.

One of the highlights is "Personal", which is written in remembrance of Chrissy's friend, Julius Trombino, who passed away in 2016. It is about how Chrissy resolves her emotions of consternation, frustration, and misery. Eventually, she manages to find the determination to become a courageous person and assures to honour his memory: "I'll lace up my armour and fight for us both, finish what you started and crown your stone". The strong chorus reminds us of their hit "Gravity", and the resemblance may be on purpose for emphasising the paramountcy of her friend as her own gravitational force.

Their stunning live performances have also received praise with their interactive sessions in each concert. Their Asia tour celebrating the release of Past Lives will embark in November and Hong Kong will be their third stop, as promised by Chrissy two years ago in Mong Kok's Macpherson Stadium. Fans must not miss this wondrous opportunity to check them out next month in Mong Kok!
