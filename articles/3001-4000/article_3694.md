The second round of the French Presidential election, set to take place this Sunday, is one of the most remarkable, but also uncertain, polls in living memory.

The first round saw four candidates running neck-to-neck with anyone of them could have made it into the second round. They are Marine Le Pen of the National Front, Emmanuel Macron of En Marche, Francois Fillon of the Republican Party and Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the La France insoumise.

To the credit of pollsters after being battered for their blunders in the Brexit and Trump polls, their pre-poll results fell within 0.6 per cent margin of the eventual vote share of each candidate.

The first round was in itself remarkable and unexpected with few had predicted in the earlier stages of the campaign that Macron’s or Mélenchon’s prospect on entering the second round.

The efforts of Macron, a centrist, pro-EU and pro-globalisation candidate, to position himself as an outsider despite having worked as the economy minster for the current government and only quit the socialist party a year ago, have paid off.

Mélenchon, the hard left candidate enjoyed a massive surge in popularity after his fiery performance in the live debates, putting him within a shout of making into the second round.

Marine Le Pen, having stepped aside temporarily as the leader of the National Front was predicted to come either first or second in the first round in various polls.

In many ways, Macron has been fortunate, benefiting from various candidates issues.

Francois Fillon, the Republican candidate, had been poised to enter the second round of the election. He ranked comfortably first or second in polls before the “Penelope gate”. His wife Penelope Fillon and his children were alleged to have got pay from the government by working for him as assistants. It was discovered by reporters. Although there is little evidence in suggesting that they actually put in any work, he is now under formal investigation. It is worth noting he had portrayed himself as a clean candidate during the campaign, and telling the public that if he was under any formal investigation he would withdraw his candidacy. When he was placed under formal investigation later on, he did not do so.

The Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon only received a dismal 6% of the votes, which signaled a spectacular fall and the need of some soul searching for the Socialist party, bearing in mind the current President Francois Hollande, the Socialist party member won the election just five years ago.

Macron benefited from both issues. Before the “Penelope gate”, Fillon was poised to not only making into the second round, but also beating the any remaining candidate in the second round. He had been polling at around 23% before “Penelope gate” with Marine Le Pen consistently at around similar margins. With no evident overlapping of voters between Macron and Le Pen, Macron could have been the one who missed out had it not been “Penelope gate” as he had been polling around very close to Fillon’s numbers. With the polls and eventual outcome, it would be reasonable to suggest that the “Penelope gate” cost Fillon around 4% of the votes, with him receiving 19.5% of the votes in the first round.

Macron also benefited from the eventual winner of the Socialist Party. Many predicted that Manuel Valls, the former Prime Minister would win the Socialist primary, where instead Hamon, a self-identified French version of Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn sprung a surprise and won. His is a more of a radical left than Manuel Valls, with his signature proposed policy being a 32 hour work week.

Manuel Valls’ more moderate left standing in the political spectrum could have cost Marcon some crucial votes had he made it as the Socialist Party Presidential candidate, with that Hamon eventually received around 6% of the votes.

#### Now Macron finds himself in the second round against the far right candidate in Marine Le Pen, he is the favourite to win the second round with a 20 points advantage according to various polls.

#### But if Brexit and Trump’s victory taught us anything, it is that anything is possible.

Many French papers, desperate not to have a Le Pen presidency have already accused Macron of celebrating too early and acting as if he has already won the second round of the election.

Indeed Macron has to be cautious, because while it is easy to draw up different circumstances that enabled Trump and Leave camp to win in the United States and the United Kingdom respectively, it is equally easy to draw up similarities of the three events.

In the past France has always been determined to avoid the National Front winning the presidency. Indeed in 2002 when Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the National Front and the father of Marine Le Pen shocked the country by winning enough votes to go through to the second round, not only millions went on the street to protest against him, but the political parties also got together issuing “Pacte Républicain”, urging all the voters across parties to vote against Le Pen.

In the end Jean-Marie Le Pen’s opponent Jacques Chirac won the second round by a landslide, winning 82.2% of the votes

The relative lack of backlash this time around can be attributed to Marine Le Pen’s effort of normalising the National Front since she took over from her father, pushing it towards a more mainstream image in the public eye.

This time around things are a bit more uncertain. Although Fillon and Hamon both urged it supporters to vote for Macron,Mélenchon did not, instead asking the 19% of voters that voted him to vote with their own will in the second round, subsequently receiving criticism for not explicitly asking his supporters to vote for Macron.

Former Republican President Nicolas Sarkozy meanwhile had to apologize that he seemed to have urged voters to vote for Macron on the Republican Party’s behalf and had to clarify that his pledge to people voting for Macron was issued as an individual.

Meanwhile a movement called #SansMoiLe7Mai has been gaining ground rapidly across various social media platforms, with French voters suggesting that they will abstain or voting neither candidate.

Marine Le Pen has a very motivated and loyal group of voters, so they will be unlikely to abstain.

This is a worrying sign as the more voters abstain the more it will hurt Macron’s chances due to various reasons.

It is more likely that voters that have voted in the first round that decided to abstain from the second round will be voters that voted the candidate they like such as Fillon, Mélenchon or Hamon. Especially the 19.5% that voted for Mélenchon, as he did not ask his voters to vote for Macron in the second round.

How effective will the pledges of Fillon and Hamon be? What will the Mélenchon voters do at the second round? How well Macron will have done reaching out to them? These three questions will decide who will have the keys for the Élysée Palace for the next 5 years.
