# The worst nightmare, the mightiest struggle for survival

By Hongyu Wang

Except nuclear tests and the mockeries of Kim Jong-un's haircut, the world press at large seldom cast coverage on the darkest place on earth – North Korea. In is not their fault, though. Three generations of the Kim dynasty have chosen a sealed border to isolate its people from the outside world. With all information blockaded from entry into the Hermit Kingdom and unimaginable terror at home, its 25 million people are trapped in the biggest living hell on earth and vanished from all sights.

There are, however, a tiny few who have lived to see the lights. Over the decades around 28,000 people have made to South Korea, often having endured fatal treks fleeing to China and horrible human trafficking whilst hiding from China's repatriation, before risking one final attempt to cross into the likes of Mongolia and Thailand for rescue. Approximately 300,000 are trapped in China with mostly women been sold to peasants as wives and held as mistresses.

Yeonmi Park, author of In Order to Live, was on the great escape. She recently spoke on a gathering at the Island Evangelical Community Church, organised by Hong Kong Student for Liberty when I was in attendance.

It is hard for the rest of us, even those living under brutal dictatorships, to fathom what Ms Park had been through all those years. Unlike any other place in the world, North Korea is where every mind and soul is brainwashed, much like been genetically engineered, to live only to serve the supreme leader. "Do not even whisper [anything else], even the birds and mice and hear you", as Ms Park recalled her mother's warning. Dead bodies and hungry beggars were common scenes of Ms Park's childhood memory, when the country's food ration system collapsed following the fall of Soviet Union. Memories of public execution and visit of state security agents were afresh even years after her flee.

Hope is the only thing stronger than fear. A smuggled movie Titanic from China into Ms Park's border town and lights across the Yalu River planted curiosity in her young heart that life somehow was different in another universe. But Ms Park's eventual flee wasn't a search for freedom; it was out of desperation for a bowl of rice. If this indescribable absurdity is out of your wildest imagination, think of District 12 in the novel Hunger Games. When I was reading through the book after Ms Park's talk, Panem's districts often surfaced in my nightmare.

It was when Ms Park's father was imprisoned for metal trade and sales to China that the family's songbun, or caste, plummeted. If there had been three meals day, Ms Park and her sister were only surviving in wild nature now. But fleeing to China was entering another hell. With no exposure to sex ever, a thirteen-year-old Ms Park saw her mother raped, to protect her, in front of her eyes the first thing they sneaked cross the Yalu River. Sold for US$ 260 with her mother's price tag at only 65, Ms Park was taken her innocence and kept as her broker's mistress for almost two years in exchange for buying her mother back and trafficking her dying father, who had developed colon cancer in prison camp, into China.

Looking back, Ms Park's otherworldly refusal to accept a pre-ordained life, even in the worst possible circumstance when there is nothing of her fault, did play a part in her continued search for dignity. And this time it meant to cross Gobi desert to Mongolia under minus 30 degrees, following the northern star to freedom. To Ms Park, Julius Caesar's immovable northern star was the only living being to witness her existence should her small troupe of defectors unable to make it. To human life's unbelievable resilience, Ms Park did make it to South Korea and began a tough yet free new life.

Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. Now a free young woman, Ms Park, having gone through unlearning her past to assume nothing had happened, is a determined voice not only on her own terrible sufferings, but on her country people left behind in the cold. Ms Park is promising to the whole world, alone but mighty, a Mockingjay on her free will, that life can go on no matter how bad the losses, and wounds can heal and new life can prosper in truth, love and freedom. Ms Park is also a living testimony that nothing is here to stay for ever. However strong the dictators are, once enslaved people are exposed to the truth, kindled with love and freedom, all those efforts of deceit and terror are to be blown away in the twinkling of an eye.

Coming from where humanity is at its worst, Yeonmi Park celebrates the eternal strength of an indomitable spirit that extinguishes fear, destroys limits and makes everything possible.

As Ms Park said at the Foreign Correspondents' Club,

> I could have been killed many many times before so I almost take this life as something plus life. I don't really try to be affected by that. I really hope even if I am gone that we remember the people of North Korea and remember North Korea is not about politics.


> If I die, I am OK. I mean I already experienced this freedom [in South Korea]. So I am satisfied. So at least I can say that I did something for you, my people in North Korea,


said Ms Park on Special Broadcasting Service of Australia.
