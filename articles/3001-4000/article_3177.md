# 我的周末歌單35──The Hollies - Long Cool Woman (In A Black Dress)


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629025853if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/1l0xpkk0yaQ" >}}


Saturday night I was downtown   
 Working for the FBI   
 Sitting in a nest of bad men   
 Whiskey bottles piling high   
 Bootlegging boozer on the west side   
 Full of people who are doing wrong   
 Just about to call up the DA man   
 When I heard this woman singing a song   
 A pair of 45´s made me open my eyes   
 My temperature started to rise   
 She was a long cool woman in a black dress   
 Just a 5-9 beautiful tall   
 With just one look I was a bad mess   
 'Cause that long cool woman had it all   
 I saw her heading to the table   
 Well a tall walking big black cat   
 When Charlie said I hope that you're able, boy   
 Well I'm telling you she knows where it's at   
 Well then suddenly we heard the sirens   
 And everybody started to run   
 Jumping under doors and tables   
 Well I heard somebody shooting a gun   
 Well the DA was pumping my left hand   
 And she was holding my right   
 Well I told her, "Don't get scared   
 'Cause you're gonna be spared"   
 Well I'm gonna be forgiven   
 If I wanna spend my living   
 With a long cool woman in a black dress   
 Just a 5-9 beautiful tall   
 With just one look I was a bad mess   
 'Cause that long cool woman had it all   
 Had it all, had it all, had it all...

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
