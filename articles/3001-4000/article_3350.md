# 我的周末歌單39－R.E.M. - Losing My Religion (Official Music Video)


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210707065022if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwtdhWltSIg" >}}


Oh life, it's bigger   
 It's bigger than you   
 And you are not me   
 The lengths that I will go to   
 The distance in your eyes   
 Oh no, I've said too much   
 I set it up

That's me in the corner   
 That's me in the spotlight   
 Losing my religion   
 Trying to keep up with you   
 And I don't know if I can do it   
 Oh no, I've said too much   
 I haven't said enough

I thought that I heard you laughing   
 I thought that I heard you sing   
 I think I thought I saw you try

Every whisper   
 Of every waking hour   
 I'm choosing my confessions   
 Trying to keep an eye on you   
 Like a hurt, lost and blinded fool, fool   
 Oh no, I've said too much   
 I set it up

Consider this   
 Consider this, the hint of the century   
 Consider this, the slip   
 That brought me to my knees, failed   
 What if all these fantasies come   
 Flailing around   
 Now I've said too much

But that was just a dream   
 That was just a dream

That's me in the corner

That's me in the spotlight   
 Losing my religion   
 Trying to keep up with you   
 And I don't know if I can do it   
 Oh no, I've said too much   
 I haven't said enough

But that was just a dream   
 Try, cry, why try   
 That was just a dream   
 Just a dream   
 Just a dream, dream

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
