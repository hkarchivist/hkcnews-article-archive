# 我的周末歌單38－Dire Straits - Brothers In Arms


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210708053638if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/jhdFe3evXpk" >}}


These mist-covered mountains   
 Are a home now for me   
 But my home is the lowlands   
 And always will be   
 Some day you'll return to   
 Your valleys and your farms   
 And you'll no longer burn   
 To be brothers in arms

Through these fields of destruction   
 Baptisms of fire   
 I've witnessed your suffering   
 As the battle raged high   
 And though they did hurt me so bad   
 In the fear and alarm   
 You did not desert me   
 My brothers in arms

There's so many different worlds   
 So many different suns   
 And we have just one world   
 But we live in different ones

Now the sun's gone to hell   
 And the moon riding high   
 Let me bid you farewell   
 Every man has to die   
 But it's written in the starlight   
 And every line in your palm   
 We're fools to make war   
 On our brothers in arms

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
