# 我的周末歌單37－Eric Clapton - Wonderful Tonight (Live In San Diego)


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629022906if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIzOxTCOc_0" >}}


It's late in the evening; she's wondering what clothes to wear.   
 She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair.   
 And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"   
 And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."

We go to a party and everyone turns to see   
 This beautiful lady that's walking around with me.   
 And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"   
 And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."

I feel wonderful because I see   
 The love light in your eyes.   
 And the wonder of it all   
 Is that you just don't realize how much I love you.

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head,   
 So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.   
 And then I tell her, as I turn out the light,   
 I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight.   
 Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight."

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
