[Verse 1]   
 In the mornin you go gunnin'   
 For the man who stole your water   
 And you fire till he is done in   
 But they catch you at the border   
 And the mourners are all singin'   
 As they drag you by your feet   
 But the hangman isn't hangin'   
 And they put you on the street

[Chorus]   
 You go back Jack do it again   
 Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round   
 You go back Jack do it again

[Verse 2]   
 When you know she's no high climber   
 Then you find your only friend   
 In a room with your two timer   
 And you're sure you're near the end   
 Then you love a little wild one   
 And she brings you only sorrow   
 All the time you know she's smilin'   
 You'll be on your knees tomorrow

[Verse 3]   
 Now you swear and kick and beg us   
 That you're not a gamblin' man   
 Then you find you're back in Vegas   
 With a handle in your hand   
 Your black cards can make you money   
 So you hide them when you're able   
 In the land of milk and honey   
 You must put them on the table

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
