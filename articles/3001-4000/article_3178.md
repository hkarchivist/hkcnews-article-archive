# 我的周末歌單36──Santana ~ Black Magic Woman with sensational belly dancer


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629025851if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDLLXUaqZxg" >}}


Got a Black Magic Woman   
 Got a Black Magic Woman   
 Yes, I got a Black Magic Woman   
 She's got me so blind I can't see   
 But she's a Black Magic Woman and   
 she's trying to make a devil out of me

Don't turn your back on me, baby   
 Don't turn your back on me, baby   
 Yes, don't turn your back on me, baby   
 Don't mess around with your tricks   
 Don't turn your back on me, baby   
 'cause you might just wake up my magic sticks

You got your spell on me, baby   
 You got your spell on me, baby   
 Yes, you got your spell on me, baby   
 Turnin' my heart into stone   
 I need you so bad   
 Magic Woman I can't leave you alone

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
