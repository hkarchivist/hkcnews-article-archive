# 我的周末歌單43--Crosby, Stills & Nash (Live) - Wooden Ships

[Stills:] If you smile at me I will understand   
 'Cause that is something   
 Everybody everywhere does in the same language   
 [Crosby:] I can see by your coat, my friend you're from the other side   
 There's just one thing I got to know   
 Can you tell me please who won?   
 [Stills:] Say can I have some of your purple berries?   
 [Crosby:] Yes, I've been eating them   
 For six or seven weeks now haven't got sick once   
 [Stills:] Probably keep us both alive

Wooden ships on the water very free and easy   
 Easy, you know the way it's supposed to be   
 Silver people on the shoreline let us be   
 Talkin' 'bout very free and easy

[Instrumental (Electric Guitar)]

Horror grips us as we watch you die   
 All we can do is echo your anguished cries   
 Stare as all human feelings die   
 We are leaving, you don't need us

Aaaah ...   
 Go take your sister then by the hand   
 Lead her away from this foreign land   
 Far away where we might laugh again   
 We are leaving, you don't need us

And it's a fair wind   
 Blowin' warm out of the south over my shoulder   
 Guess I'll set a course and go

[Ending (Electric Guitar and Organ)]

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
