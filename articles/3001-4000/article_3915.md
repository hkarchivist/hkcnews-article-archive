It doesn't hurt me   
 Do you wanna feel how it feels?   
 Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?   
 Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 Be running up that building   
 See if I only could, oh   
 You don't wanna hurt me   
 But see how deep the bullet lies   
 Unaware I'm tearing you asunder   
 Oh, there is thunder in our hearts   
 Is there so much hate for the ones we love?   
 Well tell me, we both matter, don't we?   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 Be running up that building   
 Say, if I only could, oh   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy   
 Oh c'mon, baby, c'mon darling   
 Let me steal this moment from you now.   
 C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling   
 Let's exchange the experience, oh   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 I'd be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 See and if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 So if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 I'd be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 So if I only could   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 If I only could, I'd be running up that hill   
 If I only could, I'd be running up that hill

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
