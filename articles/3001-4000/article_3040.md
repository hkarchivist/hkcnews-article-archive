# 我的周末歌單31--Prince Purple Rain Live 2007

I never meant to cause you any sorrow   
 I never meant to cause you any pain   
 I only wanted one time to see you laughing   
 I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain   
 Purple rain, purple rain   
 Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover   
 I only wanted to be some kind of friend   
 Baby, I could never steal you from another   
 It's such a shame our friendship had to end

I only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey I know, I know, I know times are changing   
 It's time we all reach out for something new   
 That means you too   
 You say you want a leader   
 But you can't seem to make up your mind   
 I think you better close it   
 And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain   
 Purple rain, purple rain

If you know what I'm singing about up here   
 C'mon, raise your hand

Purple rain, purple rain

I only want to see you, only want to see you   
 In the purple rain

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
