# Fate of UK mired in doubt amid Brexit

By Jonathan Lai

After the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union last year, Prime Minister Theresa May is set for carrying the task and starting negotiation of the political divorce.

There is nothing wrong about people voting about the country's own future, which is a fundamental expression under democracy. How damaging economically Brexit will be is well documented. It is nothing when compared to the fate of the 300 years of Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The reason why Scottish National Party set the date of the second referendum just around the end of the Brexit negotiation between the UK and the EU is crystal clear. And if the UK or Theresa May are actively pursuing a "hard" Brexit, then surely that will only give Nicola Sturgeon more convincing reason to the Scots voting for a yes this time around.

And given that the noises coming out from Brussels were that its either no Brexit or "hard" Brexit, the image is clear.

Another crucial point that went under the radar by the mainstream media is how the political landscape in North Ireland has changed. For the very first time the pro union party does not have a majority in the parliament. And would Northern Ireland want a hard border between themselves and Ireland?

How does Theresa May ignore the border issues of Ireland and Northern Ireland is incomprehensible. She has to deal with the issue sooner rather than later, but unfortunately this is a much bigger problem that people realised. And given the state of chaos at the moment, no one is paying remotely enough attention on this or coming up with at least some sort of plan.

#### Again, if it will indeed be a "hard" Brexit, couple that with the above mentioned issue, Northern Ireland leaving the union in the next decade does not seem so unthinkable anymore.

Move on to probably a taboo subject in the UK. We will all die one day, and the chances are that the older you get, the closer you are to death. The Queen has been such an icon of Great Britain, some say the one last soul binding the Nation together, the last sign of the greatness of Britain. She is 90 and is not getting any younger. One day the day will come, although thorough preparation are already in place, but the event will certainly have an impact on the wider political landscape.

For the first time both the party in power and the opposition party of the Australian parliament agree on wanting Australia to become a republic after the thorn has been handed to another person.

If we join the dots together and make a bold guess, we might see in 10 years a United Kingdom without Scotland and Northern Ireland and Australia leaving the Commonwealth after the hand over of the thorn of the Monarch.

Maybe the leavers and the Brexiteers do not mind taking a hit economically for Brexit as "they have had enough of experts", if so try presenting the scenario of the above paragraph and see how will they respond.

The simple fact is, Theresa May simply has to get the best deal available, the opposite of the "hard" Brexit she seems to be heading towards. A "hard" Brexit will suit her own interest as a politician, strengthening her grip as the Prime Minister, but disastrous to the country.

David Cameron almost went into the history books as the person that tore apart a 300 year's union with Scotland leaving. His successor should not want to carry this title with one country leaving the union, let alone two.

A "hard" Brexit will be devastating, suicidal in every single aspect whether you view this from an economic, social or cultural perspective. It risks reducing the UK to little England. And once the integration of the Union happened, there is no turning back.

Theresa May might be right in saying politics is not a game after all, once hard Brexit happened, and the possible breakdown of the union followed suit, she should know that there will not be a reset button for all that.

Given the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances, no one is holding her accountable, not the Euro-skeptic media, not the opposition party. With virtually no opposition, she is taking the UK to wherever she wants, which is something extremely dangerous when you are also the most powerful person in the country.

The 48 per cent Remain needs to do everything possible to hold her into account, it has to be a powerful, organised group of stakeholders, pressuring Theresa May into making the lightest Brexit possible.

#### The fact that Brexit is a significant point in the United Kingdom's history should be evident to everyone, and the 48 per cent needs to throw the kitchen sink at the negotiations and make themselves heard, and right now, the volume they are producing is minimal to say the least.

If not, as present indication shows that Theresa May will be taking the United Kingdom to the hardest deal possible, a suicide act, and bring everyone in the United Kingdom with her, unless Scotland and Northern Ireland quickly realised that they do not wish to commit suicide and found a way out, in this case, England and Wales might just be left alone and taking all the pain there will be for a "hard" Brexit.

The Prime Minister's recent call of snap election in June seemed to be based on the intention of gaining a mandate on Brexit that she already has, so instead in could be interpreted as a way of strengthening her grip of power before the shortcomings of Brexit are thoroughly exposed during the negotiations, which is due to be completed in at least two years' time. And given that the Conservative Party is 20 points ahead of the opposition party in various polls, it seemed to be a fairly straight forward choice in order to increase the slim majority that the Conservative Party holds. Moreover, if she managed to increase the majority the party currently holds, she may be able to have a clear run regarding the matter of Brexit with virtually no opposition within her party and any significant opposition from the Euro skeptic media and the Labour party.

What the snap election will also offer is a platform for the 48 per cent to speak out. Liberal Democrats already made their stance as anti-Brexit ages ago and the election will be a precious opportunity for the party to increase its share of seats in the parliament. Their success will hinge on how they and the 48 per cent Remain can spread the message of a hard Brexit, or even Brexit will damage the United Kingdom itself. The Prime Minister's initial reluctance of calling the election right after the referendum result last year meant that some of the negative impact of Brexit has already been bubbling across the surface, (especially after the official announcement of triggering Article 50 last month) such as inflation and the collapse of the pound sterling. The 48 per cent-plus sections of the mild leavers that have already witnessed that Brexit could be damaging to the United Kingdom will be the votes that they are targeting for this election.

The 48 per cent have a very narrow window with this unexpected election, and very little time to get the job done. How well will they fare with the task? We will certainly have an answer in less than 40 days.
