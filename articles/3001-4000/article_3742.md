# 我的周末歌單45－Joni Mitchell - Circle Game


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706091538if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMMbmXeQqvI" >}}


Yesterday a child came out to wonder   
 Caught a dragonfly inside a jar   
 Fearful when the sky was full of thunder   
 And tearful at the falling of a star   
 And the seasons they go round and round   
 And the painted ponies go up and down   
 We're captive on the carousel of time   
 We can't return we can only look behind   
 From where we came   
 And go round and round and round   
 In the circle game   
 Then the child moved ten times round the seasons   
 Skated over ten clear frozen streams   
 Words like, when you're older, must appease him   
 And promises of someday make his dreams   
 And the seasons they go round and round   
 And the painted ponies go up and down   
 We're captive on the carousel of time   
 We can't return we can only look behind   
 From where we came   
 And go round and round and round   
 In the circle game   
 Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now   
 Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town   
 And they tell him,   
 Take your time, it won't be long now   
 Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down   
 And the seasons they go round and round   
 And the painted ponies go up and down   
 We're captive on the carousel of time   
 We can't return we can only look behind   
 From where we came   
 And go round and round and round   
 In the circle game   
 So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty   
 Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true   
 There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty   
 Before the last revolving year is through   
 And the seasons they go round and round   
 And the painted ponies go up and down   
 We're captive on the carousel of time   
 We can't return, we can only look behind   
 From where we came   
 And go round and round and round   
 In the circle game   
 And go round and round and round   
 In the circle game

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
