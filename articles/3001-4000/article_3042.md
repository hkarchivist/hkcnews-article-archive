# 我的周末歌單33－Shirley Bassey - Diamonds Are Forever (Official song HD/HQ) Original Version


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210629025900if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFSAWiTJsjc" >}}


Diamonds are forever,   
 They are all I need to please me,   
 They can stimulate and tease me,   
 They won't leave in the night,   
 I've no fear that they might desert me.

Diamonds are forever,   
 Hold one up and then caress it,   
 Touch it, stroke it and undress it,   
 I can see ev'ry part,   
 Nothing hides in the heart to hurt me.   
 I don't need love,   
 For what good will love do me?   
 Diamonds never lie to me,   
 For when love's gone,   
 They'll lustre on.

Diamonds are forever,   
 Sparkling round my little finger.   
 Unlike men, the diamonds linger;   
 Men are mere mortals who   
 Are not worth going to your grave for.   
 I don't need love,   
 For what good will love do me?

Diamonds never lie to me,   
 For when love's gone,   
 They'll lustre on.   
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.   
 Diamonds are forever, forever, forever.   
 Forever and ever.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
