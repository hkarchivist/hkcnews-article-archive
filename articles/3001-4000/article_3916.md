"If I only could, I'd be running up that hill.   
 If I only could, I'd be running up that hill."

It doesn't hurt me.   
 Do you want to feel how it feels?   
 Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?   
 Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?   
 You, it's you and me.

And if I only could,   
 I'd make a deal with God,   
 And I'd get him to swap our places,   
 Be running up that road,   
 Be running up that hill,   
 Be running up that building.   
 If I only could, oh...

You don't want to hurt me,   
 But see how deep the bullet lies.   
 Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.   
 Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.

Is there so much hate for the ones we love?   
 Tell me, we both matter, don't we?   
 You, it's you and me.   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy.

And if I only could,   
 I'd make a deal with God,   
 And I'd get him to swap our places,   
 Be running up that road,   
 Be running up that hill,   
 Be running up that building,   
 Say, if I only could, oh...

You,   
 It's you and me,   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy.

"C'mon, baby, c'mon darling,   
 Let me steal this moment from you now.   
 C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling,   
 Let's exchange the experience, oh..."

And if I only could,   
 I'd make a deal with God,   
 And I'd get him to swap our places,   
 Be running up that road,   
 Be running up that hill,   
 With no problems.

If I only could   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems...

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
