# 我的周末歌單47－America - I Need You


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210706091538if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThTplavLL7w" >}}


We used to laugh, we used to cry   
 We used to bow our heads then, wonder why   
 And now you're gone, I guess I'll carry on   
 And make the best of what you've left to me   
 Left to me, left to me

I need you like the flower needs the rain   
 You know I need you, guess I'll start it all again   
 You know I need you like the winter needs the spring   
 You know I need you, I need you

And every day, I'd laugh the hours away   
 Just knowing you were thinking of me   
 And then it came that I was put to blame   
 For every story told about me   
 About me, about me

I need you like the flower needs the rain   
 You know I need you, guess I'll start it all again   
 You know I need you, I need you   
 I need you like the winter needs the spring   
 You know I need you, guess I'll start it all again   
 You know I need you, I need you

I need you like the flower needs the rain   
 You know I need you, guess I'll start it all again   
 You know I need you, I need you   
 I need you like the winter needs the spring   
 You know I need you, guess I'll start it all again   
 You know I need you, I need you ...

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
