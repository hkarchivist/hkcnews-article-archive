See these eyes so green   
 I can stare for a thousand years   
 Colder than the moon   
 It's been so long   
 And I've been putting out fire   
 With gasoline

Feel my blood enraged   
 It's just the fear of losing you   
 Don't you know my name   
 Well, you been so long

See these eyes so red   
 Red like jungle burning bright   
 Those who feel me near   
 Pull the blinds and change their minds   
 It's been so long

Still this pulsing night   
 A plague I call a heartbeat   
 Just be still with me   
 Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru   
 You've been so long   
 Well it's been so long   
 And I've been putting out fire   
 with gasoline   
 putting out fire   
 with gasoline

See these tears so blue   
 An ageless heart   
 that can never mend   
 These tears can never dry   
 A judgement made   
 can never bend   
 See these eyes so green   
 I can stare for a thousand years   
 Just be still with me   
 You wouldn't believe what I've been thru

You've been so long   
 Well, it's been so long   
 And I've been putting out fire   
 with gasoline   
 putting out fire with gasoline

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
