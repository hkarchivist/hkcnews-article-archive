Angie, Angie, when will those clouds all disappear?   
 Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?   
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats   
 You can't say we're satisfied   
 But Angie, Angie, you can't say we never tried   
 Angie, you're beautiful, but ain't it time we said good-bye?   
 Angie, I still love you, remember all those nights we cried?   
 All the dreams we held so close seemed to all go up in smoke   
 Let me whisper in your ear:   
 Angie, Angie, where will it lead us from here?   
 Oh, Angie, don't you weep, all your kisses still taste sweet   
 I hate that sadness in your eyes   
 But Angie, Angie, ain't it time we said good-bye?   
 With no loving in our souls and no money in our coats   
 You can't say we're satisfied   
 But Angie, I still love you, baby   
 Ev'rywhere I look I see your eyes   
 There ain't a woman that comes close to you   
 Come on Baby, dry your eyes   
 But Angie, Angie, ain't it good to be alive?   
 Angie, Angie, they can't say we never tried

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
