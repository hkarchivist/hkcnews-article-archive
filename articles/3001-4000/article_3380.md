【Written by: Kayser】

I was taking a quick walk with my dog Gemini tonight and realized the red sky above my head. I haven't seen this hue since last year and I took this quick snap of it with my phone.

Well, I snapped this picture because of something not shown in this picture. It's Gemini and me. He's staring at the red sky, one foot on my foot, and I was petting him, kissing him on his forehead. And he's happy.

That means everything. This picture is a moment Gemini and I shared just now.

今天傍晚帶我家小狗Gemini出去走走，頓然發現天上一大遍紅色的彩霞。上次見到這麼紅的天空，已是去年的事了。因為沒有準備，只舉起手中的手機拍下這一剎那的景象。

這張照片的重點卻沒有放在這照片之內。Gemini閃爍的眼神，定睛望着的那個天空。我看着牠眼裏反映的紅色，牠好像在這一刻和大自然連接起來，有一種生命力發出來的美。我彎身蹲在牠身旁，和牠一起望。我親親牠的前額，牠把尾搖一搖，引頸望着我。我知道牠這一刻是快樂的。

這是一種滿足。

這照片，記下的是我和Gemini凝望的那一個天空，是我和牠分享過的快樂。

**博客 | Florence & Kayser**

Hong Kong. New York. Eight thousand miles from each other. A half-day apart. Two vibrant cities with different cultural and political backgrounds, experiencing their respective changes in this cross-road time of history. Reflections upon one, perhaps, may shed light upon the other. Florence & Kayser, two Hong Kongers living in America sharing thoughts and stories of the big Apple and beyond.
