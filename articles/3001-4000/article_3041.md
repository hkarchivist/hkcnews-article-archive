# 我的周末歌單32－Pink Floyd - Money (Official Music Video)

Money, get away   
 Get a good job with more pay and you're O.K.   
 Money, it's a gas   
 Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash   
 New car, caviar, four star daydream,   
 Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back   
 I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.   
 Money, it's a hit   
 Don't give me that do goody good bullshit   
 I'm in the hi-fidelity first class traveling set   
 And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime   
 Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie   
 Money, so they say   
 Is the root of all evil today   
 But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away

"HuHuh! I was in the right!"   
 "Yes, absolutely in the right!"   
 "I certainly was in the right!"   
 "You was definitely in the right. That geezer was cruising for a bruising!"   
 "Yeah!"   
 "Why does anyone do anything?"   
 "I don't know, I was really drunk at the time!"   
 "I was just telling him, he couldn't get into number 2. He was asking why he wasn't coming up on freely, after I was yelling and screaming and telling him why he wasn't coming up on freely.   
 It came as a heavy blow, but we sorted the matter out."

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
