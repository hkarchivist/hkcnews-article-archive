# 我的周末歌單46－Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210712005039if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/wp43OdtAAkM" >}}


It doesn't hurt me   
 Do you wanna feel how it feels?   
 Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me?   
 Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making?   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 Be running up that building   
 See if I only could, oh   
 You don't wanna hurt me   
 But see how deep the bullet lies   
 Unaware I'm tearing you asunder   
 Oh, there is thunder in our hearts   
 Is there so much hate for the ones we love?   
 Well tell me, we both matter, don't we?   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 Be running up that building   
 Say, if I only could, oh   
 You   
 It's you and me   
 It's you and me won't be unhappy   
 Oh c'mon, baby, c'mon darling   
 Let me steal this moment from you now.   
 C'mon, angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling   
 Let's exchange the experience, oh   
 And if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 I'd be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 See and if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 Be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 So if I only could   
 I'd make a deal with God   
 And I'd get him to swap our places   
 I'd be running up that road   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 So if I only could   
 Be running up that hill   
 With no problems   
 If I only could, I'd be running up that hill   
 If I only could, I'd be running up that hill
