# 我的周末歌單67─Tell Me Why-Declan Galbraith


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210702100408if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/_j6IBdHW_rY" >}}


In my dream children sing a song of love for every boy and girl   
 The sky is blue and fields are green and laughter is the language of the world   
 Then I wake and all I see is a world full of people in need

Tell me why (why) does it have to be like this?   
 Tell me why (why) is there something I have missed?   
 Tell me why (why) cos I don't understand.   
 When so many need somebody we don't give a helping hand.   
 Tell me why?

Everyday I ask myself what will I have to do to be a man?   
 Do I have to stand and fight to prove to everybody who I am?   
 Is that what my life is for to waste in a world full of war?

(Children) tell me why? (Declan) tell me why?   
 (Children) tell me why? (Declan) tell me why?   
 (Together) just tell me why, why, why?

Tell me why (why) does it have to be like this?   
 Tell me why (why) is there something I have missed?   
 Tell me why (why) cos I don't understand.   
 When so many need somebody we don't give a helping hand.

Tell me why (why, why does the tiger run)   
 Tell me why (why, why do we shoot the gun)   
 Tell me why (why, why do we never learn)   
 Can someone tell us why we let the forest burn?

(Why, why do we say we care)   
 Tell me why (why, why do we stand and stare)   
 Tell me why (why, why do the dolphins cry)   
 Can some one tell us why we let the ocean die?

(Why, why if we're all the same)   
 Tell me why (why, why do we pass the blame)   
 Tell me why (why, why does it never end)   
 Can some one tell us why we cannot just be friends?

(Why, why do we close our eyes?)   
 (Why, why do we really lie?)   
 (Why, why do we fight for land?)   
 Can someone tell us why cos we don't understand?   
 Why, why?

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
