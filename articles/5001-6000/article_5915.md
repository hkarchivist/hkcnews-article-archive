# 我的周末歌單71－Lobo - How can I tell her


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701091001if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFwGI492XCU" >}}


She knows when I'm lonesome, she cries when I'm sad   
 She's up in the good times, she's down in the bad   
 Whenever I'm discouraged, she knows just what to do   
 But girl she doesn't know about you.

I can tell her my troubles, she makes them all seem right   
 I can make up excuses not to hold her at night   
 We can talk of tomorrow, I'll tell her things that I want to do   
 But girl how can I tell her about you.

How can I tell her about you   
 Girl please tell me what to do   
 Everything seems right whenever I'm with you   
 So girl won't you tell me how to tell her about you.

How can I tell her I don't miss her whenever I'm away   
 How can I say it's you I think of every single night and day   
 But when is it easy telling someone we're through   
 But girl help me tell her about you.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
