# 我的周末歌單70－Lulu - To Sir With Love


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701090959if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVQ4vAmM7Y" >}}


Those schoolgirl days of telling tales and biting nails are gone   
 But in my mind I know they will still live on and on   
 But how do you thank someone who has taken you from crayons to perfume?   
 It isn't easy, but I'll try   
 If you wanted the sky I would write across the sky in letters   
 That would soar a thousand feet high 'To Sir, With Love'   
 The time has come for closing books and long last looks must end   
 And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend   
 A friend who taught me right from wrong and weak from strong   
 That's a lot to learn, but what can I give you in return?   
 If you wanted the moon I would try to make a start   
 But I would rather you let me give my heart 'To Sir, With Love'

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
