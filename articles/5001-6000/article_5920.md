# 我的周末歌單71－Rod Stewart - Maggie May [Live Unplugged Video]

Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you   
 It's late September and I really should be back at school   
 I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used   
 Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried any more   
 You lured me away from home just to save you from being alone   
 You stole my heart and that's what really hurt

The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age   
 But that don't worry me none in my eyes you're everything   
 I laughed at all of your jokes my love you didn't need to coax   
 Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more   
 You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone   
 You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand   
 But you turned into a lover and   
 mother what a lover, you wore me out   
 All you did was wreck my bed   
 and in the morning kick me in the head   
 Oh Maggie I couldn't have tried anymore   
 You lured me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone   
 You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school   
 Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool   
 Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helpin' hand   
 Oh Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face   
 You made a first-class fool out of me   
 But I'm as blind as a fool can be   
 You stole my heart but I love you anyway

Maggie I wish I'd never seen your face   
 I'll get on back home one of these days

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
