# Government must act on Coroner's report on killer tree

**By Twiggy Ngo, Paul Chan, and Edward Yiu**

A Coroner's Inquest was held in October 2017 to examine the cause of death of a pregnant woman in the fallen tree incident on Robinson Road in 2014. The jury ruled that it was an accidental death and proposed the government to enact legislation to regulate the responsibility of tree maintenance on private land. Tree law, which has been discussed for years, has once again become a heated topic. The then-Secretary for Development Paul Chan refused to enact legislation under the pretext of a lack of practitioners. The number of practitioners is simply a matter of demand and supply. Aren't his grounds too weak? After a long delay and detailed suggestions from the Coroner's Court, shall the government still avoid the matter of legislating a tree law?

Here's a brief summary of the jury's eight suggestions:

**- Legislation should be enacted to regulate trees on private land, including registration, regular maintenance and engaging qualified persons to conduct risk assessment.**

**- The authorities should issue clear guidance to relevant management parties of the premises and urge them to manage the trees properly on private land.**

**- The government should set up a dedicated department for strengthening inspections of trees on private land.**

**- More funds should be earmarked for the Tree Management Office (TMO) to organize professional talks for property management companies and contractors as well as to better educate the public**

**- A registration regime for professional arborists should be set up.**

**- The government should subsidize tree inspection staff to be trained so that we have more qualified arborists in Hong Kong.**

**- Owners' Corporations should attach more importance to tree management.**

**- Private property management company should hire professional arborists for regular tree inspection in housing estates.**

Tree law was proposed to strengthen the regulation of private landlords' responsibilities, but it has always been "talking the talk, but not walking the walk". Some people believe that such concept is similar to the Buildings Ordinance – the owners are responsible to hire professionals for design, construction, supervision, repair, maintenance, and inspections. However, trees are not governed by the Buildings Ordinance.

Recently, there are more and more accidents caused by trees. A few years ago, the Legislative Council proposed to enact a tree law, using a legal framework to regulate tree management, including dealing with dangerous trees and protecting old and valuable trees. Of course, it would seem to be more productive having a statutory framework for regulatory control instead of reliance on civil liability alone. Yet, the key of an effective tree law is not only to regulate dangerous trees, but also to attach importance to the ecological network of trees. This is why the tree law in other countries, such as the UK and Australia, works.

The reason of success of the tree protection law in these countries is a holistic urban forestry concept to support forestry management. Take Sydney and Melbourne as examples, where urban forestry strategies will be evaluated from time to time. The policies in these cities showed that they understand that trees are not individual plants but an ecology and part of the urban forestry. Effectiveness cannot be attained by evaluating plants one by one.

From 2011, through technical circular and practice notes, the Hong Kong government indirectly required new development projects, including both public and private ones, to offer no less than 20% of the site area for greening. The government has been proactive in promoting urban greening, so there will be more and more trees in the urban area. With the density of a city like Hong Kong, trees can pose a high potential risk to life and property. A well-designed mechanism for urban tree management is thus urgently needed.

Currently, landscaping planning and design in new development projects in Hong Kong, including the approval of the location of greenery, types of plants, and the integration with buildings, do not require the participation of landscape architects. The plans will only require confirmation by authorized persons under the Buildings Ordinance. This makes it difficult to ensure that project designs can provide appropriate environment for planting, including insolation, soil, irrigation, drainage, ventilation, etc. The supervision and implementation of construction process of the project does not require the involvement of landscape architects or arborists. It is therefore difficult to ensure no mistake is made when dealing with existing and new trees in the construction site (such as not removing a plastic bag that wraps around the root before plantation). These mistakes will affect the health of trees or even their stability.

The concept of urban forestry in Hong Kong is not mature at present. We suggest that the framework of the law not only imposes management of hazardous tree, tree risk assessments, and the conservation of old and valuable trees, but also to introduce routine "tree health assessments" by relevant professionals.

Instead of resorting to tree-felling whenever a risk is detected, the ecosystem and the promotion of biodiversity should serve as the basis for formulating standards of landscaping, construction, conservation, and inspections.

In fact, similar problems have arisen in government-owned trees. In October, we held the first interdisciplinary tree management seminar, in which participants largely agreed that diffused responsibilities are the fatal flaws of Hong Kong's tree management policy—the bureau has policy concerns, and individual departments have their own concerns, impeding proper policy implementation. The incident involving concrete-covered roots in October 2017 may have been a result of miscommunication between departments and contractors. But whether the tree law can constrain government departments and integrate the responsibilities over government-owned trees is still something that needs to be pursued.

Therefore, we believe the tree law should besides regulate the responsibilities over trees on private land, it should also integrate the responsibilities over government-owned trees, and that is not limited to regulating both hazardous and old trees; but promoting the concept of ecologically-friendly forestry, introducing tree health assessment, and setting up a "Tree and Forestry Bureau" that has real authority in the formulation and promotion of tree and urban forestry strategy and its implementation across Hong Kong.

A Tree and Forestry Office can be first set up in the short term, expanding the current roles of the Tree Management Office. It coordinates with the Landscape Office to commence research on the scope of relevant policies and to carry out the legislation process, fully implementing the eight suggestions from the jury: that includes strengthening the regulation of trees on private land, and apart from requiring property owners to carry out routine inspections and follow up with the conditions of the trees, it must also set up a database for trees on private land right away to facilitate monitoring work.

The government can consider offering appropriate assistance and subsidies to private property owners to manage trees well, which provides incentives to improve the environment.

The government should also introduce an accountable licensing system for local arborists, allowing the government, industry, and property owners to establish short-term and long-term forestry strategies with a common vision. This can also rectify Hong Kong people's misconception that trees are dangerous.

Tree management does not only involve tree risk assessment; it also concerns caring for the health of trees, designing urban forestry environments for the co-existence of trees and humans. Trees can serve the world meaningfully if we provide it with care from its birth to its death.

To further promote the above idea, we plan to establish an interdisciplinary platform that involves qualified arborists, professional landscape architects, lawmakers and tree-loving NGOs, following up with the above suggestions by different approaches. Having met with the government officials, we have got the dialogue started and we look forward to your participation in the next seminar we plan to hold soon.
