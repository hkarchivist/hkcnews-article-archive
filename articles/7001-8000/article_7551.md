# Housing Policy in Urgent Need of Revamp

By Ho Lok-sang

It is an enigma that while Hong Kong has been named as the world's freest economy, it has also imposed extraordinary and highly distortionary taxes on real estate transactions. Since November 2010 Hong Kong has introduced, by stages, the Special Stamp Duty (SSD), then the enhanced Special Stamp Duty and the Buyer's Stamp Duty (BSD), then the Double Stamp Duty (DSD). This last ad valorem tax was later enhanced and unified to become the 15% tax levied on all residential properties newly purchased if one already owns one. All of these stamp duties were part of a "demand management" strategy aimed at curtailing demand. They will be called "extraordinary stamp duties" in the following, and they all belong to the category of taxes called transactions taxes, which are acknowledged by economists to be highly distortionary and inefficient.

Among all extraordinary stamp duties, the Buyer's Stamp Duty is the only one that may make sense in Hong Kong's context today, but it should be levied only on foreign buyers who do not reside in Hong Kong. Foreigners who do not reside in Hong Kong naturally have less need than those who do. When supply is short, it is ostensibly justifiable to ask these foreigners to pay an extra tax. But being a cosmopolitan city, Hong Kong really should treat expatriates who work in Hong Kong like Hong Kongers, and allow them to buy their homes just as other Hong Kongers do—without the punitive stamp duty. They are not taking any welfare benefit and are paying the market price to buy their homes. Today's Buyer's Stamp Duty is not only levied on foreigners including expatriates who work in Hong Kong, but also on Hong Kong companies in order to combat tax avoidance. Unfortunately, the cost is huge. Genuine Hong Kong companies are hit. One collateral damage from the BSD is that all property investment activities for the purpose of preservation and renovation have stopped completely. Unlike the case of buying for demolition and redevelopment, there is no provision for BSD refund in the case of preservation and renovation.

**Heavy Cost of Transaction Taxes**

As for the other extraordinary stamp duties, social costs are all higher than benefit. Apart from the regular or normal stamp duty, they do not have a place in Hong Kong.

What are these social costs?

The most obvious one, of course, is that all these transaction taxes take a toll on transactions. When a transaction is lost, both the potential buyer and the potential seller have lost the gains that could have been realized. When the Special Stamp Duty prevails, the seller who would have liked to sell and trade up to a better unit is likely to stick to the unit that he had wanted to sell. Trading up would have allowed them to live in a more spacious flat and would have released their homes to entry-level buyers. As existing owners stay put instead of trading up to better housing, they have given up an opportunity to improve their living conditions. Since a transaction involves a buyer and a seller, just as the seller gives up a benefit, so the potential buyer also gives up a benefit: the benefit of buying the unit in the existing homes market, and thus improving their living conditions.

The Special Stamp Duty has dramatically reduced the supply of entry level homes, directly causing a run-up in their prices. This is making buying the first home more difficult and more precarious for first time buyers, since many of them are not rich and cannot afford price declines, and they are paying very high prices.

The relationship between the housing market and the macroeconomy has been studied using Hong Kong data by Ho and Wong (2008). There it was found that housing market booms and busts produce a huge effect on domestic demand. A recent paper by two top economists using UK data found that "temporary transaction tax cuts are an enormously effective form of fiscal stimulus." A corollary of this is that the imposition of transaction tax that is expected to be temporary is an enormously strong form of fiscal cooling, implying significant negative effect on the economy. The positive effects of property price increases on the economy have been demonstrated repeatedly, and they largely consist of a wealth effect that boosts consumption, and a credit bolstering effect that encourages borrowing and investment. A statistical exercise, presented in the Appendix, shows that the SSD and associated extraordinary stamp duties has reduced the positive effects of housing prices on domestic demand.

Declines in the volume of transactions also have more direct effects on the economy, because many economic activities are directly associated with housing transactions. Taking the brunt of the blow is the property brokers, who have to rely on transactions to earn a commission. Related is the lawyers who specialize in property conveyancing. Because fewer homeowners trade up, the demand for home moving services also falls, and there will also be a decline in retail sales as typically moving to a new home would entail replacement of some home furnishings.

It is no accident that Hong Kong's economic growth has been subdued since 2010.

Evidence that the Special Stamp Duty actually drives up home prices, especially for starter homes is not difficult to come by. Before the SSD was introduced, the housing market was operating smoothly, and in such normal times the price increases of starter homes typically lag behind those of larger homes when the market is on an upward trend.

Figure 1 shows how the housing price index for Class A compares with that for the combined Class D and Class E, where A refers to the smallest units with salable area less than 40m2 and D and E refer to those at or bigger than 100m2. They started off at 100 in 1999. Through 2008, the biggest flats had enjoyed price increases far bigger than those of the smallest flats. From 2008 to 2009 the gap narrowed as the Global Financial Tsunami hit the biggest flats the hardest. But when housing prices rose again, the gap widened as before—until the end of 2010. Following the introduction of the SSD, and throughout the period after, the gap between the two indices shrank, eventually ending up in a dramatic reversal, as the price index for the smallest flats overtook that for the biggest flats.

Notes: The solid line represents the house price index of Class A. The dash line represents the house price index of Class D&E. The vertical line refers to the start of counter-cyclical measures in October 2009.

From this perspective, the Special Stamp Duty not only hurts potential sellers and buyers, but also produces spillover effects that hurt other homeowners and buyers as well. The Double Stamp Duty has aggravated the situation, because a homeowner who wants to trade up normally would firm up a purchase before selling his current home. Because this would make them liable to pay the double stamp duty, they may refrain from trading up, unless they can be exempted. The SAR Government eventually allowed homeowners who trade up to have half a year to sell their own homes and still be exempt from the double stamp duty and later the 15% ad valorem tax that replaced it.

Notes: The house price index (LHS) and transaction volumes (RHS) are at monthly frequency. The house price index is quality adjusted and refers to the house price in the private secondary residential housing market. The vertical lines indicate the time when each round of cooling measures is introduced. CC1 and CC2 refer to the first and second round of counter-cyclical HKMA measures in Oct 2009 and Aug 2010 respectively. CC3 to CC7 refers to the subsequent rounds of counter-cyclical HKMA measures. SSD1 and SSD2 refer to the special stamp duty and its enhancement in Nov 2010 and Oct 2012 respectively.

Although the rate of price inflation for the bigger flats fell behind that for the smallest flats, they were nevertheless positive. Thus the aggregate house price index continued to rise notwithstanding the various "demand management measures" including the SSD, the Buyer Stamp Duty, and the Double Stampt Duty. Figure 2 shows that apparently the demand management measures not only did not slow down the price inflation of dwelling units in Hong Kong, but also might have exacerbated the inflation.

In recent years, developers have become prone to producing very tiny flats, which had been dubbed "nano flats." According to the SCMP, "nano flats" with sizes starting from 128 square feet (12 square meters) – are now under construction at TPlus in Tuen Mun and will be leased for HK$4,000 per month, or HK$31 per sq ft. This is a market response to the increase in the square foot prices of smaller flats, which in turn is due to a decline in supply because the upward movement of households to bigger flats has stalled thanks to the SSD and other stamp duties that raise transaction costs. Another related development is the sharp rise in the rentals of rooms subdivided from a regular flat. Because the supply of flats for starter homes is so low on account of the SSD, many people cannot afford them and have to make do with partitions from flats. As the population of those living in substandard housing goes up, so does the demand for public housing. According to the Housing Authority, at the end of March 2017, there were roughly 147 300 general applications for Public Rental Housing, and about 128 600 non-elderly one-person applications under the Quota and Points System. The average waiting time for general applicants had risen to 4.6 years, while that for elderly one-person applicants was 2.6 years.

It is possible to make small changes to the existing measures to reduce the negative impacts.

To minimize the negative effects of the SSD, we can allow the owner occupier to be exempt from the SSD if he sells his currently occupied unit, whether or not it is resold within three years after he first purchased it. This would immediately take away the worry that in the event circumstances require the resale of the unit which the household had traded up to, it would be liable to a heavy tax. This change is very small, but it would immediately free households from that worry and may trigger much trading-up activity. This will increase the supply of starter homes, and will allow many households to improve their living conditions. This change is much better than extending the tax-exempt period from 6 months to 12 months. The household may just sell, and wait for an opportune time to buy again. The freedom to sell and buy at any time and still be exempt from the SSD as long as the unit concerned is for owner-occupancy will be a great relief for households, and will not benefit any speculators.

Another initiative, which is consistent with minimal change of the existing measures and yet may help increase transaction activities, is to allow investors who already have more than one housing unit to register with the Land Registry. After registration, they can dispose a unit of their properties and are eligible to buy another one any time without incurring the 15% ad valorem tax. This policy means that only additions to existing holdings will become taxable. With this change, investors will be better prepared to sell their units without the fear that should they buy again they would have to pay an extra 15%. I believe the proposed change will encourage investors to sell some of their holdings in the near future, thus helping to alleviate upward pressures on prices. Although they may buy again to replenish their stocks, supply will be greater in the future, and in any case any net increase in holdings will still be taxable.

In addition, changing the pricing formula and resale restrictions of new HOS housing may be appropriate. The key to stemming panicky buying lies in changing people's expectations. If HOS prices are no longer tied to those of private flats buyers can wait. It is proposed that the government announce that Hong Kong permanent residents who are married are eligible to buy one starter home in their life time at a price that is tied to the median household income, such as 10 times annual household income. The units as starter homes are relatively small in size, with a usable area of 400 square feet, so that the buyers will have the incentive to move out if their financial conditions allow. The units can only be used as owner occupied housing and owners are not allowed to own other properties in Hong Kong. They can only be resold to other couples who are eligible for the new HOS housing without having to repay a land premium. Of course location and other factors that affect property values mean that the pricing formula applies in an "average sense" only, allowing upward or downward deviations depending on location. This revised formula of pricing for new, for-couple-only, HOS housing will immediately alleviate the urge to buy, because the government's commitment to allow eligible households to buy at a price that will not rise faster than incomes will prove a strong incentive not to rush in, lest prices might rise beyond their means later.

**Recommendations**

First, the SSD be changed so that principal residences are exempt from it.  A homeowner on reselling his own home can register with the Land Registry that he has done so, and then a new unit purchased for the purpose of principal residence will not be subject to the SSD, regardless of when it is resold.

Secondly, investors can register with the Land Registry the number of units held.  After registration, they are allowed to sell and buy without incurring the ad valorem tax of 15%, as long as the total holdings do not increase beyond the number registered.

Thirdly, for subsidized homeownership housing, it will be highly desirable to require owners not to own private homes, and to restrict resale only to those who are eligible to buy subsidized homeownership housing. If these rules are in force, then no land price premium should be payable. These rules will take away the investment motive to buy HOS housing, and reduce the prices of HOS housing in the second hand market.

Fourthly, in the future, the average price of HOS housing can be set at some multiple of median household income—with variations upward or downward depending on floor, location, and other factors. This will take away the fear that housing price increases will outpace income increases.

Fifthly, it is important to keep public housing modest or relatively basic, so that those with sufficient savings will move out to improve their housing conditions. This way public housing will be more likely to help the most needy people. Public housing with its very low rent should be considered as the first step in the housing ladder, since public housing tenants are in the position to accumulate savings for a home purchase.

**Concluding Remarks**

The big transformation of Hong Kong's housing market, from one in which second-hand transactions dominate, to one in which new home transactions dominate, is a sad story that spells troubles down the road.

First, with first time buyers now largely bypassing the second hand market, because there is very little supply in that market, a crisis is in the making. Entry level homes are getting pricier and pricier and smaller and smaller. With developers targeting mainly first time buyers, they are providing high loan-to-value ratio mortgages and supplying smaller and smaller units. First time buyers are exposed to very high risks and their purchasing power will eventually reach some limit—since there is a lower bound to the size of a flat. A crash that devastate the buyers of smaller new homes will be socially disruptive.

Second, the developers of new homes may be seen to be benefiting at the expense of the weak buyers and existing home sellers, and the government may be seen to be benefiting the big developers, wittingly or unwittingly. This undermines the image of the SAR Government, and generates social discontent.

It is important that we restore the health of the housing market by reviving transactions in the second hand market. This will benefit everybody: homebuyers as well as existing homeowners. Even developers and the wider economy will benefit, because a housing market with more vibrant second hand transactions is a more sustainable market.

It is high time for the various special stamp duties to be corrected.
