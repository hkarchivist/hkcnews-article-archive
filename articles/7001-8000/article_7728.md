Good Afternoon, Ladies & Gentlemen.

As we have seen in recent times, prosecution decisions can be very controversial. Whereas decisions to prosecute can lead to accusations of bias and heavy handedness, so also can decisions to review particular sentences generate allegations of bad faith. Although such assertions are invariably groundless, one can well understand why some people feel this way. Perceptions are important, and significant numbers of people appear to think that politics has influenced prosecutorial activity. Although such concerns have often been fanned by people who have their own political agendas to serve, there can be no doubt that damage has been done to the credibility of our prosecution service. This is a huge pity, as our prosecutors are men and women of high integrity, doing a hard job to the best of their ability in difficult circumstances.

At the start of Prosecution Week 2016, the then Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Keith Yeung Kar-hung, complained that, in "politically sensitive cases", his prosecutors had "on growing occasions been subject to groundless, malicious and unfair personal abuse, from certain members of the public", and called for this to end. However, the impression that politics is influencing prosecution decisions has not abated, but grown. Earlier this month, on 1 October, large numbers of people took to the streets to demand the removal of the Secretary for Justice, Rimsky Yuen Kwok-keung, over his role in recent prosecution decisions. One protester, Benny Tai Yiu-ting, even said that Yuen should be held responsible for what he called "political prosecutions". Clearly stung, the Department of Justice issued a press release, assuring the public that "The allegations of political prosecution or persecution are entirely unfounded".

The impression that prosecutions are becoming politicized is, regrettably, also gaining traction abroad. Although some people are badmouthing our legal system for their own reasons, this is unfortunately causing collateral damage to Hong Kong's overall reputation. To take a recent example, after the Court of Appeal decided in August to imprison three activists for their involvement in a planned, protracted and violent unlawful assembly, which left 10 people injured, the former governor, Chris Patten, mounted an irresponsible attack on our legal system. He claimed that the decision to imprison the men was "deplorable", that it was a "serious error" by the government, that Beijing must have had a hand in the decision, and that Yuen's decision to seek a review was "political", for which he produced no evidence. Although Patten was clearly mischief-making, given that he, of all people, should understand that our legal system is of the highest quality, there will be some people, both here and abroad, who take him at face value, and steps are now required to ensure that our prosecution system is, like Caesar's wife, above suspicion.

In the area of public prosecutions, public trust is vital. Although there is nothing new in prosecutors having their motives questioned, what is unprecedented is the intensity of the criticism directed at them over their handling of public order cases, sometimes by people in authority. Whilst prosecutors must not be deterred by criticism from doing what is right, there is a real danger that their legitimacy is being affected by adverse comments which are repeated ad nauseam. Although there is no quick fix, the prosecuting guidelines of both the United Nations and the International Association of Prosecutors highlight the need for the prosecutorial discretion to be exercised independently of government, and this may provide the key. Although most people sympathize with the challenges facing frontline prosecutors, it is no longer enough for the Department of Justice simply to issue anodyne statements assuring the public that there is nothing to worry about, and concrete measures are now required to institutionalize prosecutorial independence.

So long as we have a prosecution service which is headed by a government minister, the Secretary for Justice, and not by an independent prosecutor, the DPP, the credibility problems currently faced by the Department of Justice may be expected to continue, if not proliferate. The high levels of discontent over, for example, political reform, social injustice and inadequate housing, are not going to suddenly go away. In frustration, some people will, in all probability, resort again to street politics, resulting in clashes, arrests and prosecutions. Although Hong Kong has, in fact, an independent prosecution system, too many people, unfortunately, do not believe this, and they will certainly not change their minds while a political appointee continues to exercise ultimate authority over public prosecutions, as recent developments have shown.

In 2014, for example, the Secretary for Justice, Yuen Kwok-keung, belonged to the three-person constitutional taskforce which promoted the government's ultimately doomed electoral reform package. However, he was, paradoxically, in the aftermath of Occupy Central, also the official with overall responsibility for deciding which of the people arrested for protesting against his own proposals should be prosecuted, and on what charges. The optics of this situation were dreadful, with many people noting a stark conflict of interest. Some protesters, inevitably, will have been left with the impression that their prosecutions were a political payback for opposing the reforms, and this type of situation must clearly be avoided if people are to keep faith with our legal system.

Although Art 63 of the Basic Law provides that the Department of Justice shall "control criminal prosecutions, free from any interference", it does not specify which particular departmental official should actually discharge its mandate. In 2011, however, when the issue of an independent DPP was debated in the Legislative Council's AJLS Panel, the then Secretary for Justice, Wong Yan-lung, insisted that, as departmental head, he himself had to retain control of prosecutions. This narrow interpretation was immediately disavowed by the Hong Kong Basic Law Institute, which explained that, for a politically appointed government minister to be involved in prosecution decisions was, of itself, a breach of the Basic Law's "no interference" stipulation. The Institute called for the Secretary for Justice to follow the English paradigm, under which the Attorney General of England and Wales, by means of a protocol signed in 2009, effectively disengaged from public prosecutions.

The Attorney General did this by handing over the bulk of prosecutorial powers to the DPP, an independent figure without ministerial responsibilities, and, in return, undertook to safeguard "the independence of prosecutors taking decisions whether or not to prosecute in individual cases". In Hong Kong, this same switch in responsibility would not require legislation, and could be implemented internally within the department. Once the political will is there, the necessary procedural change can be readily effected, within Basic Law parameters. If, ironically, Wong Yan-lung had followed the English example in 2011, when this issue was first raised, it would, quite apart from having served the public interest, undoubtedly also have spared his successor, Yuen Kwok-keung, much of the criticism directed at him of late.

At the AJLS Panel meeting in 2011, the Hong Kong Bar Association Chairman undertook to provide the Panel with a paper setting out the Bar's position on an independent DPP. However, this eagerly awaited paper, despite numerous reminders from the Panel, never materialized. Instead, in 2015, the Panel finally received a terse, two-paragraph letter from the Bar Association Chairman, simply saying that the Bar "did not see the need for a paper on the topic", that Art 63 made provision for prosecutorial independence, and "the Bar does not see the need for any change in the statutory position". Although this perfunctory response will have been welcomed by those people determined to keep the control of public prosecutions in the hands of a government minister, it did nothing to reassure those who believe that our prosecution system needs to be modernized, particularly in light of recent events.

It must always be remembered that good prosecution policy is not just about charging the right people with appropriate offences on the basis of clear prosecutorial criteria. It is also about promoting public confidence in the legal system, which means ensuring that justice is seen to be done. There is, however, a light on the horizon, and it was reported last month that the Legislative Councillor, Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, is planning shortly to raise in the Legislative Council the issue of the DPP enjoying greater independence from the Secretary for Justice. It is very much to be hoped that the Bar Association will now take advantage of this opportunity to rethink its stance, and that it will finally come down decisively in favour of vesting the control of public prosecutions in an independent DPP, as elsewhere.

In 2011, when the idea of an independent DPP was first mooted, there were some people who queried the proposal by asking "Why now". The same people, in a campaign orchestrated by the Department of Justice after the AJLS Panel meeting, also claimed that the existing arrangement was working well, so why change it. However, recent events have shown just how blinkered that campaign was. How much better it would have been if the necessary measures to reassure the public over prosecutorial neutrality had been taken in 2011, when the political climate was still calm, and before the legal storms of recent years had developed.

It is now necessary for Yuen Kwok-keung to reverse the stance of his predecessor, and one imagines he would be happy to do this, in light of his own experiences. Apart from anything else, if he withdrew from public prosecutions he would be freed up to concentrate upon his primary role, of giving legal advice to the government. Yuen must appreciate the necessity of avoiding potentially damaging conflicts of interest, which undermine the rule of law. If, for example, he is required by the police to advise on whether the Legislative Councillor, Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, should face prosecution over his "kill without mercy" tirade, many people will suspect, if he decides that the evidence for prosecution is wanting, that the decision was taken not because of the evidence, but because Ho belongs to a political party which is supportive of the government to which he, Yuen, belongs, and such impressions should be avoided at all costs.

As Yuen must surely understand, it is only once the prosecution system is controlled by a politically-neutral DPP that the public will be reassured that politics plays no part in prosecution decisions. Of course, insiders already know that this is so, but everyone else must also be able to see it for themselves. Since Yuen is a government minister, his prosecutorial control lacks the all-important appearance of objectivity. Going forward, Hong Kong needs an independently-led prosecution service no less than it needs an independently-led judiciary or an independently-led legal profession.

It would, however, certainly be naïve to suppose that allegations of impropriety will immediately disappear once the DPP is calling the shots. But what it does mean, is that such allegations will be far fewer, and that when they are made they would carry less weight, at least to reasonably minded observers. If everyone can see for themselves that an independent DPP, no longer subservient to a government minister, is taking prosecution decisions, this will reduce concerns when controversial decisions about prosecutions are taken, and this, in turn, will strengthen the legal system.

Since 1997, Hong Kong has been fortunate to have had several justice secretaries of high quality, committed to professionalism in the discharge of their responsibilities, and to upholding the rule of law. However, any system is, ultimately, only as good as the people who operate it, and there can be no guarantee that, in the years to come, future justice secretaries will necessarily be cut from the same cloth. The sooner, therefore, that the control of public prosecutions is vested in a politically-neutral DPP the better it will be for Hong Kong.

Looking ahead, nobody know for sure what will happen after 2047, when the Basic Law's "50 years unchanged" concludes. We cannot be certain if our existing legal arrangements will emerge unscathed thereafter. If, however, Hong Kong has an independent DPP in place well before 2047, and if the arrangement is seen by everyone to be working well, then I suggest that the chances of this arrangement enduring after 2047 will be greatly enhanced. This, I believe, is a prize worth striving for.

Thank you.
