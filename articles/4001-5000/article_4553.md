# 我的周末歌單55-Depeche Mode - Enjoy the Silence


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705195234if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/aGSKrC7dGcY" >}}


Words like violence   
 Break the silence   
 Come crashing in   
 Into my little world   
 Painful to me   
 Pierce right through me   
 Can't you understand   
 Oh my little girl   
 All I ever wanted   
 All I ever needed   
 Is here in my arms   
 Words are very unnecessary   
 They can only do harm   
 Vows are spoken   
 To be broken   
 Feelings are intense   
 Words are trivial   
 Pleasures remain   
 So does the pain   
 Words are meaningless   
 And forgettable   
 All I ever wanted   
 All I ever needed   
 Is here in my arms   
 Words are very unnecessary   
 They can only do harm   
 All I ever wanted   
 All I ever needed   
 Is here in my arms   
 Words are very unnecessary   
 They can only do harm   
 All I ever wanted   
 All I ever needed   
 Is here in my arms   
 Words are very unnecessary   
 They can only do harm

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
