# Trump shakes the USA

By Jonathan Lai

It has been more than 100 days ago since Donald Trump took office in the United States and it would not be an understatement in suggesting he has turned the country upside down, with one crisis following another.

It would be safe to say that many Americans already grew tired of the constant state of chaos of the Trump administration's continuous blunders, let alone worrying about its sheer incompetency.

But there is an unlikely beneficiary amid all the chaos that has been going on day after day.

The American political satire did not have it easy during Barack Obama's tenure as president. Perhaps it should not be that surprising that the former president, who taught constitutional law for over 10 years before going into politics, certainly knows what he was talking about. People might disagree with Obama's political stance, yet in general he still managed to explain it to the public the rationale behind it.

Moreover he was a gifted speaker with good sense of humour that was evident to many. It should not come as a surprise then, that comedians found it difficult to make fun of a president back then that knew his responsibility as a president, but also when circumstances permits, did not take himself too seriously.

Everything started to change once Trump announced that he would be running for President.

The American Satire had been having a better time already during Trump's presidential campaign, but things escalated quickly once he was sworn in as the president in January.

#### The American political satire scene is having a field day with Trump's administration's incompetence, his lack of knowledge in foreign relations couple that with his impulsive personality and fragile ego.

People not just in America but from all over the world are interested in Trump's latest antics, be it his lack of vocabularies; confusing Iraq over Syria; calling Meryl Streep overrated after slamming her down during a Golden Globes speech; insisting on building the border wall; constantly bragging about his personal wealth; his various body parts; intelligence, the list goes on and on.

Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, John Oliver, Seth Meyers are the four chief beneficiaries. All of four presenters' respective segments on Trump in their shows are easily hitting reaching million clicks on Youtube.

John Oliver coverage on Trump was particular popular during the campaign trail that it was widely circulated on various social networks, receiving more than 85 million with his company calling the most watched HBO content.

It is perhaps worth noting that even Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, James Corden, three comedian turned late night talk show presenters that initially leaned more heavily on the entertainment side, are also starting to covering Trump's administration.

Saturday Night Live, a live sketch comedy show that started in the 70s is having tones of fun with Alec Bladwin and Melissa McCarthy respective impersonations of Donald Trump and Sean Spicer, the white house press secretary. Both of their segments on Youtube have been recording millions of views, some even reaching 10 million plus.

Perhaps Trump's character is so clear to everyone that it is not difficult to imagine how he would react to certain things, a cabinet member even told Alec Bladwin that his impression on the show was exactly how Trump would act like behind closed doors.

It must be stated that Trump himself played a significant role in making the American Satire great again. The fact that he gets upset when people make fun of him, so fragile is his ego that he cannot help but hit back on them, be it during a speech, an interview or on twitter at the small hours.

It has gotten to a point that the state of affairs from the Trump administration is so ludicrous that sometimes those presenters just read need to read out insiders information on the White House to various media outlets: such as him having a red button at his desk that by pushing that it, people will arrive and deliver him a can of diet coke; Or his staff telling the press on the basis of anonymity that "Trump is a moron"; Or the secretary of NATO telling the head of states to keep their speech at less than 4 minutes in the light of Trump's short attention spent; Or his staff intentionally putting Trump's name in the briefings just in order to keep him reading it. These examples were just a tip of the iceberg, as the world get to grips with a celebrity turned president's steep learning curve on learning how to govern the most powerful country in the world.

In fact, the only problem for the comedians and talk show presenters mentioned in previous paragraphs is that they have too much content to work with.

Most of their segments on Trump are taped under 10 minutes, but it would be a piece of cake for them turning their hour long show just making fun of the administration.

Amid the state of chaos in the most powerful nation on the planet, a dose of humour is much needed, just so we can all get away temporally and have a laugh in the world that we live in.
