# 我的周末歌單60─Yes - Close To The Edge


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705195235if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/51oPKLSuyQY" >}}


A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace   
 And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace   
 And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar   
 And taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour   
 And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one   
 A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun   
 And take away the plain in which we move   
 And choose the course you're running

Down at the end, round by the corner   
 Not right away, not right away   
 Close to the edge, down by a river   
 Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer   
 Reaching out to call the color of the sky   
 Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see   
 Getting over all the time I had to worry   
 Leaving all the changes far from far behind   
 We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner   
 Close to the edge, just by a river   
 Seasons will pass you by   
 I get up, I get down   
 Now that it's all over and done   
 Now that you find, now that you're whole

[II Total Mass Retain]

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love   
 It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above   
 I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand   
 There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see   
 As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea   
 There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river   
 Close to the edge, round by the corner   
 Close to the end, down by the corner   
 Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden cause shouldn't take away the startled memory   
 All in all, the journey takes you all the way   
 As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known   
 Guessing problems only to deceive the mention   
 Passing paths that climb halfway into the void   
 As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner   
 Close to the end, down by a river   
 Seasons will pass you by   
 I get up, I get down

[III I Get Up, I Get Down]

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking   
 Saying that she'd take the blame   
 For the crucifixion of her own domain

I get up, I get down   
 I get up, I get down

Two million people barely satisfy   
 Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late   
 The eyes of honesty can achieve   
 (She would gladly say it amazement of her story)   
 How many millions do we deceive each day?   
 (Asking only interest could be layed upon the children of her domain)

In charge of who is there in charge of me   
 (She could clearly see the lady sadly looking)   
 Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?   
 (Saying that she'd take the blame   
 For the crucifixion of her own domain)   
 The truth is written all along the page   
 (She would gladly say it amazement of her story)   
 How old will I be before I come of age for you?   
 (Asking only interest could be layed upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down   
 I get up, I get down   
 I get up, I get down

[IV Seasons Of Man]

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes   
 A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems   
 And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love   
 As song and chance develop time, lost social temp'rance rules above   
 Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space   
 He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race   
 I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place   
 On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley   
 Called to witness cycles only of the past   
 And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the river   
 Down at the end, round by the corner   
 Seasons will pass you by   
 Now that it's all over and done   
 Called to the seed, right to the sun   
 Now that you find, now that you're whole   
 Seasons will pass you by

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
