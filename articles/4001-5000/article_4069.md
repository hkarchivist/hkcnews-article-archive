Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky   
 Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together   
 Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere   
 Stormy weather, just can't get my poor self together   
 I'm weary all the time, the time   
 So weary all the time

When he went away the blues walked in and met me   
 If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me   
 All I do is pray, the Lord above will let me   
 Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, everything I had is gone   
 Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together   
 Keeps raining all the time   
 Keeps raining all the time

I walk around heavy-hearted and sad   
 Night comes around and I'm still feeling bad   
 Rain pourin' down, blinding every hope I had   
 This pitter an' patter an' beatin' an' spatterin', drivin' me mad

Love, love, love, love   
 This misery will be the end of me

Can't go on, everything I had is gone   
 Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together   
 Keeps raining all the time, the time   
 Keeps raining all the time

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
