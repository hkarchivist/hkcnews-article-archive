# 我的周末歌單57-Cliff Richard - The Young Ones


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210705195233if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxNohANhJiA" >}}


The young ones,   
 Darling we're the young ones,   
 And young ones shouldn't be afraid.

To live, love   
 While the flame is strong,   
 For we won't be the young ones very long.

Tomorrow,   
 Why wait till tomorrow,   
 Tomorrow sometimes never comes.   
 Love, me,   
 There's a song to be sung   
 And the best time is to sing while we're young.

Once in every lifetime   
 Comes a love like this.   
 I need you and you need me.   
 Oh my darling can't you see.   
 Young dreams   
 Should be dreamed together,   
 Young hearts shouldn't be afraid.   
 And some day when the years have flown   
 Darling, this will teach the young ones of our own.   
 The young ones   
 Darling, we're the young ones   
 The young ones   
 Darling, we're the young ones.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
