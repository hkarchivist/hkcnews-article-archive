# 我的周末歌單59─Joe Jackson - Steppin' out (Night of the Proms Rotterdam 2015)

Now   
 The mist across the window hides the lines   
 But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine   
 Electricity so fine   
 Look and dry your eyes   
 We   
 So tired of all the darkness in our lives   
 With no more angry words to say   
 Can come alive   
 Get into a car and drive   
 To the other side   
 Me babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 You babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 We   
 Are young but getting old before our time   
 We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind   
 Don't you wonder what we'll find   
 Steppin' out tonight   
 You   
 Can dress in pink and blue just like a child   
 And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile   
 We'll be there in just a while   
 If you follow me   
 Me babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 You babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 Me babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 You babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light   
 Me babe, steppin' out   
 Into the night   
 Into the light

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
