# 我的周末歌單51－Billie Holiday－I'm A Fool To Want You


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704154015if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/rejizpNR20A" >}}


I'm a fool to want you   
 I'm a fool to want you   
 To want a love that can't be true   
 A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you   
 Such a fool to hold you   
 To seek a kiss not mine alone   
 To share a kiss that Devil has known

Time and time again I said I'd leave you   
 Time and time again I went away   
 But then would come the time when I would need you   
 And once again these words I had to say

Take me back, I love you   
 ...I need you   
 I know it's wrong, it must be wrong   
 But right or wrong I can't get along

Without you

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
