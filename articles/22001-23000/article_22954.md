# Supporting HKG from YYZ


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20220121044318if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/wuJ8MzUkjNo" >}}


**By A YYZ HK-born Canadian citizen**

On Canada's soil, in front of Toronto's Old City Hall, Camp BJ, breached the chain perimeter around the sacred Old City Hall Cenotaph, climbed up to the main platform of the cenotaph and waved a couple flags of their beloved country. 😡 And oh, the police gave them warning and got them back on the ground. Good job, Police!

On Canada's soil, when Camp HK sang the National Anthem, O Canada, Camp BJ raised their middle finger in utter disrespect.

When Camp BJ chanted "One China", Camp HK responded with "Two Systems", as well as "Free China" 😂.

When Camp BJ yelled "我们支持香港警察" (we support the HK police, in Mandarin), Camp HK gave them "知法犯法" (lawkeeper is the lawbreaker, in Cantonese (the mother tongue of HKers)).

I am not sure how, really, that more than one person, who claim to love 祖國 so much, would hold its flag in reverse. Can't tell its left from right? Beats me! 👉👈

The YYZ Rally did not happen. The Police were afraid that there might be physical conflicts. For Camp HK, it was a part stand-up, part sit-down lawful assembly; lawful because the organizers have informed the Police and got the official permit. For Camp BJ, oops, I heard it was an unlawful assembly 🤣. Gloria Fung, spokesperson of Canada-HK Link, said Camp BJ will face whatever they deserve. I couldn't tell you how cool that felt under a hot sun.

p.s. before the start time of the rally, it was pouring really really hard; we even saw hail for a brief time; then, the sun came and stayed for the rest of the event. It's a reminder to myself that: Indeed, he who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps. We shall overcome!

香港加油！光復香港　時代革命！

Note：The Old City Hall Cenotaph is one of several locations where Torontonians observe the [Remembrance Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20220121044318/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day) .
