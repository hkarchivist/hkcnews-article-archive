# 獸醫界聯署：為無法出聲的動物爭取安全

各位獸醫界同僚：

就如各位一樣，對於二零一九年七月二十一日發生在元朗的嚴重暴行，我們感到深深的震驚、傷痛、沮喪、憤怒，這暴行傷害的不單是當時的途人，也傷害了香港整個城市，以及香港市民的心。當時身穿白衣的數百人，手持武器，特意襲擊西鐵站內人士——因各種原因如外出歸家、放工等等的普通市民。

這絕對不是我們追求的。我們應該為下一代建立榜樣，應該為下一代建立更美好的香港；然而，在過去數月，香港已經急速禮樂崩壞。

我們作為獸醫、獸醫助護，愛護生命、拯救生命是我們的天職，我們應該為拯救我們的城市多做一點。我愛我的城市，我們都希望香港可以更美善，是以我們應站在一起一同譴責香港特區政府，譴責特區政府無力履行其職務保護這美麗城市、保護香港人。

#### 當日，由於就在門前的暴力，一些位於元朗的動物診所需要關門拉閘，我們需要請主人專程來把仍然生病的動物帶回家，主人們除了擔心自家寵物，更要擔心獸醫診所職員的安危。

#### 當我們連這些動物也無法保護，我們實在感到這個社會已經潰爛。我們一定要為無法出聲的發聲，我們應為這些暴力所危害的兒童、寵物爭取安全。

**希望你會與我們同行，簽署這份聲明，以獸醫、獸醫助護的身份要求政府正視以及正面回應這五個社會已提出多時的訴求：**

1) 全面「撤回逃犯條例」   
 2) 釋放所有相關被捕人士及撤消其相關控罪   
 3) 撤回612暴動定義   
 4) 成立獨立調查機構追究警隊濫權行為   
 5) 立即實行雙普選

同時，對721元朗襲擊事件作出深入調查。

這是我們的家，我希望我們可以一起保護這個美麗的城市，重建香港為一個和平的城市。

Dear Colleagues,

Like many of you, we were horrified, pained, frustrated and angered by what was happening in Yuen Long on July 21st, 2019. A mass of violence erupted that has shook this city and its citizens. With what seemed like a gang of people dressed in white shirts and armed with weapons purposely targeting Hong Kong citizens who were just guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even a pregnant woman was left bloodied and injured by these thugs.

People simply trying to get home from work, attacked on public transport and senselessly beaten just for being from Hong Kong.   
 This is not what we strive for. We aim to be an example to the next generation and to leave Hong Kong better than when we were given the responsibility. However in the last couple of months, it is clear that the situation has become untenable and our leadership has failed this city.

As veterinarians our jobs are about loving and saving lives and we must do more to ensure that we save this city. We love this city and want to see Hong Kong thrive, therefore we must join together in condemning the Hong Kong Government and their inability to do their most basic job, protect the citizens of this wonderful city.

Clinics had to be closed in Yuen Long because of the violence happening outside their doors. We had to send sick animals away, and worry their owners because our staff were in danger.

When we can’t even protect these animals from humans, it feel like we have lost as a society. We must speak for those without a voice. We must continue to fight for the kids and the pets who these gangs have endangered.

Please join me in this petition to the Hong Kong government for a continued demand to respond to the 5 requests from the protestors:

1. Complete withdrawal of the Extradition Law   
 2. Release all arrested protestors   
 3. Remove the characterisation of rioters from June 12th, protests   
 4. Independent inquiry into police behaviour   
 5. Universal Suffrage   
 and also a thorough investigation into the triad involvement in the violence on July 21st.   
 This is a place we call home and it is our hope we can all help to support, protect and rebuild this beautiful city.   
 Sincerely,   
 Dr. Grace Cheung
