Dear Mrs Carrie Lam,

I am humbly writing to urge you to form an independent committee to look into the apparent police misconduct and neglect of duty displayed in the handling of recent protests and the Yuen Long attack on 21 July 2019 respectively.

### Excessive use of force and non-compliance of the Police General Order ("PGO")

Many online footages have shown that some police officers had used excessive force by beating up protestors, who were already subdued on the floor and had no weapons in hand.  Such acts clearly violated PGO 29-01 which stipulated that "only minimum force necessary to achieve the purpose may be used and once the purpose is achieves the use of such force shall cease". The Commissioner of Police ("CP") should make clear his stance and remind officers to refrain themselves instead of tolerating such acts with the excuse that officers are provocated.

### Deliberate neglect of duty in handling the Yuen Long Attack

The slow response of the police, the closing of the gates of police stations, and passive handling of the attack was a blatant and shocking neglect of duty. The time taken for the first group of police to arrive at the scene was totally unacceptable and abnormal. The officer-in-charge should be thoroughly investigated for any disciplinary offence and supervisory accountability for their failure to stop the violent attack.

I understood that at this critical point of time, CP has to maintain the morale. However, by turning a blind eye on these events, would only destroy the hard-earned trust and respect from the public and pose a greater threat to the security and stability of the city. I believe you will take prompt action in this matter and form an independent committee to investigate the above, so as to restore the public's trust.

Yours,   
 An Inspector of the Hong Kong Police
