# Rein in Professional Groups　Dissident Artistes Blacklisted

**This is translated from CitizenNews' weekly digest tracking Hong Kong's political news over the past week. （一周政情： [收服專業團體　封殺異見藝人](https://web.archive.org/web/20210911173658/https://bit.ly/2WTQs1d) ）**

In the past week, there were several prominent political stories. Firstly, the Law Society of Hong Kong's Council was re-elected and the liberal camp lost by a large margin, with pro-Beijing supporters holding a majority of seats on the Council. Secondly, the SAR Government has formally initiated legislative amendments to introduce non-locally trained doctors, and has flagrantly changed its original position that the introduction of doctors from outside Hong Kong is no longer restricted to Hong Kong permanent residents. Thirdly, the pro-Beijing media released news that the National Security Department (NSD) of the Police Force was investigating the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, including one of its directors, artiste and singer Denise Ho. The Hong Kong Arts Centre, which had originally rented a venue for Denise Ho's solo concerts, suddenly cancelled the venue booking.

The re-election of the council of the Law Society was politically charged. On the surface, all parties stressed that the Law Society is a professional body and that the election of its members should not be infiltrated by political considerations, but in reality, it was still a battle between the pro-Beijing and liberal camps. Whoever wins the five seats in the re-election will have the opportunity to control more than half of the seats in the Council and to influence the election of the President and Vice-Presidents. As a result, the Liaison Office and the pro-Beijing camp lobbied the partners of major law firms early on to personally obtain authorised votes from lawyers employed by the firms to support the five carefully packaged candidates with less obvious political affiliations.

Many leading pro-Beijing legal figures openly campaigned for them, but most surprisingly, Chief Executive Carrie Lam openly threatened the profession not to elect a director who could not work with the government, or the government would break its relationship with the Law Society. One of the liberal camp candidates was threatened and suddenly withdrew from the election, leaving the entire re-election of the Law Society in political limbo.

In the end, the election results showed a resounding victory for the pro-Beijing camp.

Although the Law Society was headed by the more neutral Chan Chak-ming, several of the vice-presidencies went to "patriotic" lawyers. The Law Society would soon be fully absorbed into the establishment. After the election, the senior lecturer of the University of Hong Kong's Faculty of Law, Eric Cheung Tat-ming, a senior member of the liberal camp, announced his resignation for personal and family reasons, giving the public a stronger impression that the open-minded faction was about to fade away from the Council, as it has been powerless in turning the tides.

In the medical profession, the pro-Beijing camp has adopted a different strategy, but in a manner unlike the Law Society, which sought to infiltrate and then control from within. The pro-Beijing side has adopted a different approach by introducing non-locally trained doctors, thus dividing the medical profession and eventually forcing the medical profession into compliance by using a government-appointed, rather than a profession-elected, body to lead the accreditation and discipline of the profession. To achieve this goal, the government blatantly broke its promise. The medical profession was originally lobbied to support the importation of non-locally trained doctors under the banner of allowing overseas-trained Hong Kong residents to return to practice in Hong Kong, in order to reduce resistance from the profession.

However, with the support of pro-Beijing political parties, the Food and Health Bureau has changed its stance and stated that the importation of overseas-trained doctors and specialists is no longer restricted to Hong Kong residents. Once this restriction was lifted, it meant that non-local doctors, including those who had graduated from prestigious medical schools in Mainland China, could be brought in on a large scale.

The reason given by the authorities is that there is a rapid loss of health care workers and the scope and number of entrants must be expanded in order to fill the large number of vacancies in public hospitals. Despite the medical profession's claim that 80% of practitioners opposed the new importation scheme, the pro-Beijing camp has taken full control of the Legislative Council after the purge and expulsion of pan-democratic lawmakers, and the bill on the importation of non-local doctors will soon be passed. The medical sector could only threaten to strike if they wanted to protest, but as the pandemic continued to worsen, it was difficult to win public support for a strike, so they could only stage a token protest in the end.

As for the arts and cultural sector, the Central Government and the SAR Government were also relentless. The hardest step was to reinstate the offence of "publishing seditious publications", which was used to suppress the leftist media during the 1967 riots, and to prosecute those who mocked the government and made the public hate it, such as Tam Tak-chi, the "quick-witted" street poseur who commented on current affairs, and the speech therapist who painted the picture books that the NSD accused to breach the National Security Law for Hong Kong, causing the entire arts and culture sector to be in a white panic, not daring to publish works that mock the government or the police. Apart from the tough measure of investigation and prosecution, the government has another tactic to deal with artistes who oppose the establishment, which is to restrict their room for survival, including the withdrawal of all public funding and the refusal of all arts and cultural venues to provide performance venues.

One of the ways of exerting pressure is for the media, the mouthpiece of the pro-Beijing camp, to release reports that the words and behaviours of an artiste have aroused the concern of the NSD, which is now investigating. In this way, government departments, public organisations and business enterprises are afraid to contact artistes even if they have not broken the law. Any contact or collaboration that might have been possible is immediately cut off, resulting in the loss of performances and income. De-facto blacklisting of Denise Ho followed this pattern. Other artistes who had criticised the government would also be worried about their careers, so they would have to keep a low profile.
