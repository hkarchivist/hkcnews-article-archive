# Franz Ferdinand continue to bring aweing elements on fifth album, Always Ascending

The Scottish indie-disco band experiments the combination of disco-punk and synth-pop on a record that you will feel youthful and enjoy dancing.

After the replacement of the rhythm guitarist and keyboardist in 2016, this album is the first one featuring a five-piece line up. The new combination does not disappoint with a heavier adoption of synth-pop and disco music, which is influenced by the critically acclaimed French synth-pop band Phoenix and producer Philippe Zdar. It has been fourteen years since their internationally recognised self-titled debut album. This album marks a big leap forward to their past era of songs built on 'straight-up guitar' riff. While Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action, their 2015 album, was more apologetic and bittersweet, the new release focuses on relaxing with an allure to enjoying a good time.

To align with their previous records, the ten songs are playfully driven by enthusiastic concepts and plenty of catchy and recurrent lyric. The self-titled track pays homage to the dance music in the 80s, it is like a reminder to themselves who their predecessors were and how they intend to elaborate on their works. Similar to their big hit Take Me Out, the verses at the beginning slowly build up the anticipation of the instrumental and chorus of the songs. As for Always Ascending, the sudden drum hits releases the stress constantly built to the climax and the melody is as captivating as usual. The sensual and spirited voice of Alex Kapranos maximises his idiosyncratic emotions of wistfulness and jubilance in Lazy Boy and Lois Lane.

The overall atmosphere of the album is entertaining. It is filled with exciting elements with a little scream of misery. Perhaps that is the main point of this album — we should vent the feeling despair in our mind and carry on with our splendid lives.
