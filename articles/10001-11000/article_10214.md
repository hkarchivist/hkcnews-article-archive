# 李紳：憫農/古風 2首 其2 (1- 鋤禾日當午)──Li Shen：Pity the Peasants/Ancient Air (1- He heaves his hoe...)

Li Shen (772-846): Pity the Peasants/Ancient Air, 2 of 2 (1- He heaves his hoe...) translated from the original——李紳：憫農／古風 2首 其2（1- 鋤禾日當午）, 17th March 2010 (revised 18.3.10; 22.3.10; 24.3.10; 25.3.10; 30.3.10; 17.8.10)

**1 He heaves his hoe in the rice-field, under the noonday sun,**   
 **1 鋤禾日當午**

**2 Onto the soil of the rice-field, his streaming sweat beads run.**   
 **2 汗滴禾下土**

**3 Ah, do you or don't you know it? That bowl of rice we eat:**   
 **3 誰知盤中飧**

**4 Each grain, each ev'ry granule, the fruit of his labour done.**   
 **4 粒粒皆辛苦**

Notes:

* This English rendition is in hexameter (6 metrical feet) while the original is in 5-character lines. The rhyme scheme is AAXA as in the original.

* Line 1: I have added the stressed "heave" to strengthen the "he-ho" sound to represent strenuous work.

* Line 2: "On-" in Onto" should be read stressed. I had considered "soggy/sodden rice-field", but have decided for the more literal "soil of the rice-field". I have, for the rhyme, used "run" instead of the literal "drip" to translate 滴 and have added "streaming" to bring out the strenuous nature of the toil.

* Line 3: The second word "do" should be read stressed. I have taken 誰知 not to mean "who knows" but to mean "do you know" or, better, "don't you know" which latter is close to須知 (meaning "you/we ought to know" or "you/we had better know" or "the truth is") subtly implied/suggested in 誰知.. For 盤中飧 I have used "bowl of rice" instead of the literal "plate of food" so as to follow through the idea of "rice" in lines 1 and 2, rice being the staple food for most Chinese. I have used "we" in "we eat" instead of "you" (to follow "do you … don't you") in order to make clear that the poem is not about any particular bowl of rice or plate of food, but about rice and food in general.

* Line 4: Here, the word "each" should be read unstressed. While the second (in "each every granule") must be read unstressed, the first (in "each grain") can be read stressed to make a spondaic (DUMDUM) foot. An unstressed reading is nonetheless preferred so as not to dilute the effect of my using the alliterative "gr" sound in "grain" and "granule" to translate 粒粒 which is only somewhat covered by the repetition of the word "each". I had originally penned the conclusion as "is all for his hard work done", then toyed with "the fruit of hard work done" and "due all to his hard work done". I have now decided for the "fruit" formulation and to use "labour" instead of "hard work", hence, "the fruit of his labour done".

**博客 | 黃宏發**

【黄宏發・唐詩英譯】前立法局主席黃宏發在中學時接觸寫詩及英譯唐詩，結下與英國文學不解緣。退休後，在2007年起有系統地將唐詩宋詞翻譯成英文並在網誌分享，十年間翻譯一百首，不求快、但求準繩，期間更屢次修訂作品，以盡力貼近詩人原意及意境。
