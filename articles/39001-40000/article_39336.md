# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 42

This is the summary for day 42 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 29 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, at least 2175 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 183 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are the new and ongoing mobile internet shutdown that has left the majority of the Myanmar population without internet access and the rapidly increasing death count from those who died from injuries sustained on Monday and those killed on Tuesday by security forces.

**Tatmadaw -** The military junta forced a shutoff of mobile internet, meaning that only those with wifi can get online, something the majority of the country cannot afford. The death toll from Monday’s crackdown has risen to 59 confirmed deaths, with at least 12 more people being killed on day 42. The regime has also put 12 townships under martial law, meaning that the military is now claiming all administrative and judicial control over these areas. The previous orders only placed certain townships and cities under curfew and limited the number of people allowed to gather. This new order suspends all civil liberties and protections. The Tatmadaw has also been fighting in Kachin State with the Kachin Independence Army, an ethnic armed organization.

CDM - Protestors continued to occupy the streets, with their bodies, barricades, and rows of signs, undeterred by the increasing violence of the security forces. People gathered nationwide, with the notable exception of Myawaddy city, a military stronghold in Karen State, where protestors have been prevented from gathering and arrests happening as soon as people try. The Restoration Council of Shan State, a Shan political organization with a military wing, has said that they are sheltering over a 100 people, mainly protesters and CDM participants, from the regime.

Emerging Stories - The trial of Aung San Suu Kyi has been postponed due to technical difficulties. Despite the junta’s official reason for staging the coup being election fraud, she has not been charged with anything related to that. Insteach she has been charged by the military with illegally importing walkie-talkies, breaking COVID-19 regulations, and incitement. The postponement may be related to the mobile internet shutdown that now leaves most of the country without internet connection. Myanmar’s elected government appointed ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, has said that the people of Myanmar now realize how brutal the military is in regards to the Rohingya genocide. This is one of the highest ranking of the Myanmar government who has acknowledged the crimes against the Rohingya. The UN has warned of the growing threat of hunger in Myanmar as the crisis continues into a second month.
