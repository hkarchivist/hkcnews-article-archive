# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 44

This is the summary for day 44 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 32 of consecutive internet blackouts and day 3 of mobile internet blackout. So far, at least 2191 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 217 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are the elected government declaring that all ethnic armed organizations are no longer considered terrorist or unlawful organizations and the loss of all private print newspapers in Myanmar.

**Tatmadaw -** The military continues to crackdown on protests, killing at least 6, though the death toll has only gotten more and more imprecise due to a high number of people dying in the hospital, security forces taking away people/bodies, and the ongoing mobile internet shutdown. This will be made worse by the cutting of public wifi networks, which were ordered to shut down on Wednesday. Security forces have now been threatening entire neighborhoods with indiscriminate shootings if protesters continue to build barricades, and have been seen destroying cars parked near protest areas. Families have also been returned the bodies of their loved ones that show severe physical abuse and torutre. The Civil Disobedience Movement continues to paralyze banking infrastructure, with many private and public bank workers on strike. The junta has responded by suspending 212 striking Central Bank workers. The regime has also levied new accusations against Aung San Suu Kyi, accusing her of corruption and of accepting bribes through her charitable foundation.

**CDM -** Nationwide protests continue, and protesters continue to adapt and experiment with different forms of expression to avoid getting violently broken up by security forces. Motorbike and marching protests have been popular, as protesters can choose paths that go around security blockades and scatter quickly. No-human protests have also become popular in recent days, where protesters create areas lined with protest signs but don’t have anyone in the area once it is set up. Candlelight vigil and early morning protest outside of curfew times have also been popular. The interim civilian government has also declared that all ethnic armed organizations throughout the country are no longer designated as terrorist organizations nor are they considered to be unlawful organizations, signaling that this government is looking to work on far more equal footing with ethnic minority groups than the previous one.

**Emerging Stories -** All local private newspapers are now no longer printing in Myanmar. Some have suspended operations for a variety of reasons, and some have had their license revoked by the military regime. This leaves people with only military run papers and online news. Given the internet limitations being imposed now, this means that millions of people now only have access to military propaganda.
