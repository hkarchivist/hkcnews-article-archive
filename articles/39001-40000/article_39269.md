# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 41

This is the summary for day 41 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 28 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, at least 2156 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 126 have been killed by security forces. Day 41 has been the single bloodiest day of the coup with at least 39 people confirmed to be dead, and the death toll expected to rise. Some local media have the number killed at over 130 people killed.

**Tatmadaw -** Security forces cracked down on protestors and killed at least 39 people and possibly more than 130 people, with the majority of the killings being concentrated in Yangon. The worst hit townships were Shwepyitar and Hlaingtharyar, which is mainly inhabited by low wage workers, especially garment factory workers, many of whom have been deeply involved in the union-led strike movement against the coup. Martial law has been announced in these townships.

In places around Myanmar, workers participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) are being forced out of their government provided housing by security forces. Charges have also been levied at administrators who refuse to open government institutions, like hospitals.

The Myanmar military, the Tatmadaw, are also continuing their campaign against ethnic minority groups, and at least 1,000 people in Karen State were forced to flee on day 41.

Yet another journalist was arrested, this time in Mandalay, and new reports have also come out from journalists who had been detained of police trying to coerce journalists false confessions that they were broadcasting fake news. The regime has also been demanding financial records from international NGOs, and it is likely these organizations will see a freezing and seizure of their assets in the coming days.

**CDM (Civil Disobedience Movement）** - Protestors are undeterred by the increasing arrests and use of live ammunition. Protestors have also been breaking the military imposed curfew to hold nightly vigils and early morning marches. The strike by government workers continues as well, and is indeed growing with an estimated quarter-million government workers now on strike.

Some protestors have begun using a strategy of “empty protests” in which they set up signs and other protest materials in high traffic areas but don’t have any actual people at the protests, thus lowering the risk of being harmed by security forces.

The interim elected government, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) have announced that people have the right to use violence in cases of self defense. Chin State has also declared itself to be self-administered and answerable to elected government and not the military. All out civil war is becoming more likely as a possibility after the last couple days of events.

**Emerging Stories -** In response to fires in garment factories in Hlaingtharyar township, the Chinese embassy put out a statement urging Myanmar to “punish the perpetrators”, something many people in Myanmar read as China’s support for the regime and the killings of dozens that happened in the same township that day. The cost of staple items, like cooking oil, have been rising, something that will hit the country’s poor the hardest.

The Arakanese National Party, a political party in Rakhine State, has announced that they will cooperate with the military regime if the junta agrees to their demands.
