# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 36

This is the summary for day 36 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 23 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, at least 1857 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 60 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are military regime raiding media offices and declaring that they are revoking the license of 5 media outlets and the continued use of violent tactics to disperse protestors that left at least two more dead.

**Tatmadaw -** Day 36 was a violent one in which at least two more people were killed and several were injured. Protesters took to the streets with women’s sarongs held aloft as flags and strung across streets on this International Women’s Day, despite an emergency order from the military regime outlawing placing women’s sarongs in places where monks or men could walk under them. This is due to a pervasive belief in Myanmar that women’s clothing can spiritually defile men. Protests turned violent quickly though.

In Mandalay, a military vehicle chased down protesters on motorbikes and hit them, injuring two. Live and rubber bullets were used in Kachin state, killing two. There were also reports of more injuries and deaths around the country in places like Shan State, Ayeyarwady Region, and Mandalay Region, though the numbers are unconfirmed.

Things came to a head in Yangon late last night, as protesters became trapped in Sanchaung township by military blockades. Soldiers stormed the township, firing stun grenades and other weapons while searching door to door for protesters. In one video of the situation, soldiers could be seen pointing their weapons at houses while calling female protestors “whores” and threatening to shoot the protesters. Most were able to leave after security forces pulled back overnight.

The military also raided the offices of local media, Myanmar Now, and evoked the media licence of 5 major news outlets, including Myanmar Now. 34 journalists have been arrested since the start of the coup.

**CDM (Civil Disobedience Movement)-** Protests continued again with varying levels of violence by the military, the least violent ones being the ones in Shan and Karen states that saw protesters accompanied by armed soldiers from local ethnic armed organizations for protections.

The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) has been successful in continuing to maintain private bank closures despite threats and enticement by the military to try and get them to reopen on March 8th. Myanmar’s ambassador to the UK, who is seen as fairly pro-military, has put out a statement saying that he takes his instructions from the civilian government.

204 workers who work for state-owned television, MRTV, have also declared that they are joining the CDM. Protestors have also touched off controversy after threatening to blow up the oil and natural gas pipeline in Myanmar that supplies China. In an effort to support the youth trapped in Sanchaung, protesters all over Yangon went out into the streets during the military imposed curfew and protested. While doing so, a group of men were detained in downtown Yangon and were found to have guns and military uniforms in their civilian vehicle.

**Emerging Stories -** Thailand has said that they are preparing for a new wave of refugees from Myanmar. Thailand hosts a large number of refugees and immigrants from Myanmar, due to the continual armed conflicts along the Myanmar-Thai border. These clashes between ethnic armed organizations and the Myanmar military have not stopped during the coup, and it is likely that as the coup drags on many people will be seeking to leave Myanmar.
