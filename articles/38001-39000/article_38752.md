# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 30

This is the summary for day 30 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 17 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far 1213 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 24 are dead. The junta and elected officials vie for legitimacy on the international stage and security forces continue a crackdown in which an estimated 1% of journalists have now been arrested.

**Tatmadaw -** Day 30 marked the 59th anniversary of the first military coup in Myanmar. The commander in chief, Min Aung Hlaing, announced that the junta is investigating financial abuse by the civilian government.

Security forces continued to crackdown on protests, using water cannon, tear gas, and live and rubber rounds. While there were reports of injuries around the country, no casualties were reported on this day. Security forces were also witnessed to have fired weapons directly into homes after protestors ran into them.

The military appointed election commission also asked for suggestions on switching to proportional representation for a new election, something many smaller parties in Myanmar have asked for in the past. The junta also made an announcement asking security forces not to use live ammunition, which shows that they are trying to frame individual officers as a “bad apples” who disobeyed orders (which they have done in the past) or they do not have control over their own forces (which is highly unlikely).

At least 30 journalists have been arrested, out of an estimated 3,000 in the country, meaning 1%of all journalists have been arrested since the coup began.

**CDM -** More police officers defect as nationwide crackdowns continue. More townships have formed township committees that are not answerable to the military. The committee of elected MPs have also appointed acting ministers to key ministries, continuing to build the dual power situation in Myanmar. 2,500 Karen villagers protested against Tatmadaw troops presence in Karen state, seeing the Bamar-ethnicity dominant army as a foreign occupation.

**Emerging Stories -** ASEAN held a meeting to discuss the Myanmar issue. They condemned the violence and called for a return to democracy. Singapore payment firm Coda has also removed Mytel, a military run telecommunications company, from its payment channel, adding to the pressure building on Myanmar by its neighbors.
