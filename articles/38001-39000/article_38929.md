# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 33

This is the summary for day 33 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 20 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, at least 1,522 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 63 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are the increasing lack of control the military has over government institutions and workers and the growing consensus among the resistance of the need to abolish the 2008 constitution under which the military is justifying their coup.

**Tatmadaw -** Security forces continued to violently crackdown on nationwide protests, using tear gas, stun grenades, and other weapons against protestors. Security forces killed a man in Mandalay, and continued their trend of denying their responsibility for the deaths of protestors in previous days. At least one slain protestor was exhumed by security forces - Kyal Zin, a young woman also from Mandalay - and cemetery staff say that they were held at gunpoint while security forces raided the grave. State-run media also continued to claim that protestors were the one being violent and accused protestors in parts of Yangon of having bombs.

The military controlled Central Bank of Myanmar has ordered all banks in Myanmar to reopen their branches and have offered to provide security personnel to entice them. This order follows an earlier order from the CBM for banks to reopen or face punishment. Many branches continue to be closed.

**CDM -** At least 10 diplomats have publicly declared themselves accountable only to an elected government, and the Myanmar Embassy in Washington, D.C. is in open revolt of the military regime.

At least 600 police officers have joined the Civil Disobedience Movement and 34 out of 45 townships have created parallel local government structures that do not answer to the junta. The committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, a body representing elected MPs, have given civil servants and government ministries until midnight of March 7th to join the CDM, after which they hope to close all government offices for 10 days to mourn the dead and then reopen with them under the control of CRPH.

CRPH has also ordered all government offices to stop collecting taxes until September 2021, and have declared that they now support abolishing the 2008 constitution and establishing a federal democracy. This has been one of the main diverging points between this NLD dominated body and the more progressive and ethnically diverse wing of the protest movement.

**Emerging Stories -** International pressure continues to mount as YouTube removes 5 military controlled channels of their platform and the US added two military conglomerates to their trade blacklist. Two people were stabbed to deaths, a local village chair of the NLD party and his 17 year old nephew, with witnesses saying the attacking mob was a group of military supporters.
