# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 26

This is the summary for day 26 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 13 of internet blackouts. The big stories of the day are the public declaration of loyalty to the Myanmar people’s elected government by Myanmar’s permanent representative to the UN and the increasing violent and widespread crackdowns by security forces against protestors. So far 771 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and 8 are dead.

**Tatmadaw -** Dozens were arrested at yesterday’s protests including a Japanese journalist. Security forces claimed to not know he was a journalist despite the fact that he was wearing a helmet identifying himself as press. The arrest brought back memories for many of the Japanese journalist who was killed during the 2007 mass protests.

Day 26 also saw crackdowns by security forces across Myanmar including Yangon, which had largely been spared until now, and dozens sustained injuries after security forces used rubber bullets, slingshots, and flash grenades. The youngest of those injured was four years old.

The Tatmadaw is also on the hunt for labor union leaders. These organizers have been at the forefront of the CDM movement. The military appointed Union Election Commission held a meeting today that was shunned by 38 of 91 parties. Those in attendance represented only 3.3 percent of the vote. The commission declared the 2020 election results invalid. Activities of elected officials and any of their committees were also declared to be illegal. The Tatmadaw also continues to fight with ethnic armed organizations and clashes were reported between them and the Karen Liberation Army.

**CDM -** Nationwide protests continue despite increasingly violent reactions by security forces. The city of Monywa, the largest city in Sagaing and consisting of a population of nearly 400,000, held a city-wide general assembly attended by tens of thousands and declared itself a self-administered city that was only accountable to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a committee of MPs elected in the 2020 election. Day 25 saw some wards, which usually consist of only a few thousand people at the most, declaring that they would not accept military appointed administrators. So this is a clear escalation by the anti-coup movement.

Myanmar’s permanent representative to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, also gave a speech imploring the international community to stand with the people of Myanmar and declared his allegiance to the CRPH. He ended his emotional speech with a three-finger salute.

**Emerging Stories -** Flash grenades from a South Korean company were found in the aftermaths of security forces crackdowns, prompting conversation on the role of international companies in supplying Myanmar government institutions like the police.
