Court of Final Appeal Succumbs Time and Again

  
 Loss of Stronghold for Rule of Law

  


  
 The final appeal against Jimmy Lai’s bail application was decided early this week. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ruled in favour of the Department of Justice (DoJ). The verdict suggested that the High Court judge who granted bail had made a mistake in principle in failing to recognise that the threshold for bail under the National Security Law (HK NSL) is higher than that for ordinary criminal offences. Therefore, Jimmy Lai must remain in remand.

  
 This ruling highlights the fact that CFA is subject to the orders of the National People's Congress (NPC). Even if HK NSL removes the most fundamental human rights protection for defendants in criminal cases under the common law system, such as the presumption of innocence and jury trials, will still be accepted by CFA. The stronghold of the rule of law in Hong Kong has disappeared.

  
 In all fairness, CFA did not give DoJ a huge victory. During the trial, several permanent judges of CFA asked the DoJ representatives many pointed questions. They wondered why HK NSL defendants could not be released on bail, and why DoJ still did not accept to allow the defendants to be released on bail, even though the Court had ordered multiple restrictions on the defendants' movement after release on bail and the risks had been greatly eliminated.

  
 These questions and judgments have left a scintilla of hope for Lai and other HK NSL defendants in the future to apply for bail. However, in general, the Court agreed with the DoJ’s literal interpretation of HK NSL. The original criminal trial system assumed that the defendant was entitled to bail (because of the presumption of innocence before conviction). However, HK NSL has changed this presumption to one of denial of bail unless the court is satisfied that granting bail would not pose a risk to national security.

  
 Under the new presumption of non-bailability, it has become extremely difficult to convince the court to grant bail, and even if the defendant is eventually acquitted, he may be held without liberty for a long time. This means that people arrested under HK NSL can lose the most fundamental human rights protection at any time. As long as the trial is delayed, they will be imprisoned for a long time. The most recent example is the case of Wan Yiu-sing (Giggs), an online radio host. The trial judge cited the verdict of Lai’s case to deny bail and sent Wan back to remand until May.

  
 Apart from opposing bail, DoJ also has a number of tricks up its sleeve to deal with HK NSL defendants, depriving them of their normal basic rights as defendants. For example, Article 46 of HK NSL is invoked, which sets out three circumstances that allow DoJ to issue a certificate that a “case shall be tried without a jury on the grounds of, among others, the protection of State secrets, involvement of foreign factors in the case, and the protection of personal safety of jurors and their family members”.

  
 The case of Tong Ying-kit was the first prosecution under HK NSL in which the defendant drove a motorcycle with the banner “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times” into police officers. There was clearly no state secrets involved, no foreign element, and no evidence that the jurors or their families would be intimidated if a jury was selected.

  
 However, DoJ continues to oppose jury trials as a matter of routine, citing “among others” before the three circumstances in Article 46. It even made up a new reason: "there is a real risk that justice may be obstructed in the proper administration of justice". However, the DoJ has not explained why there is such a risk with a jury. The public can only infer that DoJ is aware of the highly political nature of national security prosecutions and fears that a jury, chosen at random by the public, will be outraged and acquit the defendant.

  
 In order to increase the chances of conviction, the DoJ tried every possible means to prevent the establishment of a jury. In this way, the fundamental common law system of jury trials in major criminal cases collapsed under the word “among others“ in HK NSL and the reasons given by DoJ.

  
 Henceforth, whenever the police use HK NSL to arrest and prosecute, the defendant will have to face prolonged imprisonment before trial, and there will be no jury during the trial. The judge presiding over the trial must be a judge on the list of national security judges designated by the Chief Executive.

  
 No matter how unreasonable these arrangements are, or how they contravene the original criminal trial system explicitly protected by the Basic Law, the courts will not care because the HK NSL was enacted by the NPC, and the CFA has made it clear that it obeys the NPC's orders no matter what.
