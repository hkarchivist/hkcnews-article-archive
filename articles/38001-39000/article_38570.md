# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 25

This is the summary for day 25 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 12 of internet blackouts.

The big stories of the day are the violence from military supporters and security forces against those participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement and additional actions taken by Facebook and the international community against the Tatmadaw. So far 748 people have arrested, charged, or sentenced and 8 are dead.

**Tatmadaw -** Day 25 saw security forces firing guns to disperse demonstrators who were trying to stop the appointment of military appointed local administrators in Yangon. There were also multiple Yangon townships that saw heavy security forces presence in the evening with reports of weapons being discharged. There have been no reported deaths from these incidents so far.

The military regime also arrested and charged two journalists with incitement, a charge which can carry a prison term of up to 7 years. The junta also once again warned the media that they could lose their license to publish if they refer to the State Administrative Council with terms like “military regime” or “de facto government”. Independent media has largely ignored these directives and have openly stated opposition to the coup government’s attempts to stifle free expression.

**CDM -** Day 25’s protests saw groups like Kachin IDPs, internally displaced people, marching as well as a Rohingya students’ group. A public showing like this by Rohingya people would have been unthinkable before the coup. Many demonstrators also attended the protests with pots and pans, symbols of non-violent protest that have been adopted nationwide.

Groups of pro-military demonstrators also marched on this day, and in Yangon, there were many reports of pro-coup marchers attacking anti-coup protests with sticks, knives, and slingshots. Many injuries, including stab wounds, have been reported, but no deaths so far. There are reports that there are plans for massive protests repeating the 22222 protests on the 22nd on what would normally be payday, the 28th of February.

**Emerging Stories -** Japan has announced that they will be suspending new aid to Myanmar and will only continue existing aid through INGOs and civil society societies. The World Bank has announced that they will suspend Myanmar withdrawal requests. An additional 6 individuals have been sanctioned by the UK, and Facebook has announced a blanket ban on military accounts on their platforms. This comes [a day after Indonesia and Thailand met with representatives from the military](https://web.archive.org/web/20210316020058/https://www.hkcnews.com/article/38567/whatshappeninginmyanmar-38567/whatshappeninginmyanmar-day-24) .
