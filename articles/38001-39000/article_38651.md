# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 28

This is the summary for day 28 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 15 of internet blackouts. Yesterday was a dark day in which anywhere between 7 and 24 people were killed by security forces amidst the nationwide protests against military dictatorship. Most reliable sources put the number of confirmed deaths around 17-18. Those injured an/or arrested number in the hundreds.

**Tatmadaw -** In the harshest crackdown on protests yet, Myanmar security forces engaged in day-long standoffs with protestors killing people in at least 5 states and regions. Many parts of Yangon, the largest city, began to resemble battle field as protestors built baracades and police fired off tear gas, stun granades, and bullets - both rubber and live. Security forces were recorded beating those they arrested and pulling women along by their hair.

A photojournalist was also arrested and witnessed to be beaten by the 7 officers arresting her. A total of 24 journalists have been arrested since the begining of the coup.

**CDM -** Hundreds of thousands turned out for the day 28 protests nationwide and protestors continued to find new ways to resist and disrupt the military’s attempt to rule the country. As the protests became more bloody, some government doctors returned to work, and Yangon General Hospital reopened its operation theater to treat wounded protestors. Day 28 also saw religious leaders face off with solidiers, and powerful images of a lone Catholic nun asking soldiers to leave protesters alone was shared across the internet.

In Mandalay, protestors detained 5 riot police in a civilian vehicle and found a trunk full of guns. Mandalay also declared itself a self-administered city accountable only to the committee representing elected officials. This means now over 1.5 million people have declared themselves independent of military rule. Protests eventually wound down towards the evening in most places and demonstrators left, vowing to return to continue the fight.

**Emerging Stories -** While many countries and international bodies like the UN continue to use strong language to condemn the coup, protestors continue to wonder what tangible actions they will take. A lot of the conversation in the streets and online has taken to wondering “how many bodies it will take” before the Tatmadaw faces more than individual generals facing sanctions. There is a lot of people wondering whethering the world is once again failing to live up to the promise of the responsibility to protect.
