# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 35

This is the summary for day 35 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 22 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, at least 1790 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 63 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are the intensification of effort by security forces to detain dissenters and the occupation of public institutions like schools and hospitals by security forces.

**Tatmadaw -** After a couple days of what passes for restraint, the Tatmadaw has escalated their crackdown on anti-coup protests once again. Day 35 saw the renewed use of live bullets in multiple regions around the country, with many injured and possibly one dead. Security forces also violently broke up protests nationwide, using tear gas, stun grenades, live and rubber bullets, and bulldozers to disperse protestors and their defenses. Multiple videos circulated of police and soldiers beating blindfolded protesters after they were detained by security forces.

The night raids have also escalated, with reports of police breaking into people’s homes and firing into homes. Among those targeted for these nighttime arrests are prominent lawyers, activists from the 1988 uprising, and union leaders. In some cases when police cannot find the person they are looking for, they have taken family members in their stead. Day 35’s night raids were also accompanied by prolonged gun fire and multiple blasts in many townships across Yangon. Security forces now occupy many schools, universities, and public hospitals.

The military has also denied any responsibility for the death of a ward leader in their custody, despite his body showing signs that he was subject to severe beatings shortly before his death. State owned media also seemed to move the date of the election promised by the military commander-in-chief from one year after the coup to 12 to 24 months after the coup.

**CDM -** Day 35 was the last day for civil servants to join the Civil Disobedience Movement set by the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a committee of MPs elected in the 2020 election. After this, the CRPH has called for a 10-day public holiday to mourn those who have been killed since the coup. Unions have also called for an extended general strike.

All this coincides with International Women’s Day, and there are protests planned to highlight the role women have played in the anti-coup struggle, and to demonstrate against the patriarchal nature of the military and military government in the past.
