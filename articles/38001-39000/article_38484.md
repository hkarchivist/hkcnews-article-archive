# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 23

This is the summary for day 23 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 10 of internet blackouts. The military and CRPH (Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw) are both working to be recognized as the legitimate government of Myanmar. A funeral was held for Thet Naing WIn, one of the individuals killed in the crackdown in Mandalay on day 21.

**Tatmadaw -** The military continues to try and consolidate power and gain legitimacy from powerful actors within and without Myanmar. A phone call was held between the Australian Defence Force’s vice-chief and Myanmar’s second most powerful general, a fact that state-run media used to support the junta’s legitimacy abroad. The regime has offered seats to non-NLD parties on it’s administrative council and has largely been rejected.

The coup government’s newly formed Union Election Committee has also invited the political parties to a meeting. It remains to be seen who, if anyone, decides to accept this invitation and recognize the body. Employees participating in CDM have started to be suspended from their civil service positions, and Aung San Suu Kyi’s position of State Counsellor has been dissolved. So far nearly 700 people have been arrested.

**CDM (Civil Disobedience Movement)-** Protests continued nationwide, though not with the sorts of numbers we saw on day 23. Two demonstrations to note are those at the Indonesian embassy and that at the Secretariat. The protest at the Indonesian embassy was in reaction to the news on day 22 of Indonesia’s plans to support a military run election sometime in the future. Indonesia has announced that they no longer support this plan.

A vigil was held at the Secretariat for those killed so far, an especially symbolic space as General Aung San, an independence hero, was assassinated there. CRPH has also opened an International Relations Office in the US, adding to the pressure on the international community to decide which governing body of Myanmar they will recognize.

**Emerging Stories -** The United States has announced additional sanctions against two more Myanmar generals and South Korean lawmakers have called for a restoration of democracy in Myanmar.

COVID vaccinations have begun for two government departments that are not participating in CDM - prisons and customs - but not for frontline medical staff (many of whom are leading the anti-coup movement). Malaysia has deported over 1,000 refugees from Myanmar back to Myanmar despite the coup and all the unrest in the country.
