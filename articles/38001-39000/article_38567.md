# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 24

This is the summary for day 24 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 11 of internet blackouts.

The big stories of the day were the actions taken by members of ASEAN to meet with representatives from the military regime and the emerging divide between the two main leadership bodies in the Civil Disobedience Movement. 728 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced in relation to the coup, and 8 people are dead. The increase is mainly due to deaths in hospitals of the victims of the security forces’ shooting in Mandalay on day 21.

**Tatmadaw -** The Tatmadaw’s Foreign Minister traveled to Thailand to meet with his Thai and Indonesian counterparts as well as the Thai Prime Minister, who is himself in power due to a coup. This follows Indonesian supporting then retracting support for a plan for ASEAN to create a plan to hold the military to their promise of an election after the 1 year state of emergency period.

And also following the Indonesia Foreign Minister planning then cancelling a trip to Myanmar to meet with the Myanmar Foreign Minister. Protestors gathered at ASEAN embassies, or as near as they could considering police blockades in front of embassies, to protest what they consider to be actions that legitimize the coup government. Warrants have been put out for leaders of 8 major unions in Myanmar. Labor organizers have been at the forefront of the anti-coup movement. Fighting between the military and the Kachin Independence Army, an ethnic armed organization, continues.

**CDM -** The General Strike Council of Nationalities (GSCN) has sent a letter to the UN Security Council outlining their goals and their demands from the international community. Their 4 demands - ending dictatorship, abolishing the 2008 constitution, establishing a federal union, and the release of all those unjustly detained - puts them partially at odds with the other main leadership group at the moment, the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH).

The GSCN’s desire to establish an interim government that contains representatives from all ethnic groups in Myanmar is also not in alignment with CRPH, which is mainly made up of elected officials from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party.

Over 200 civil society organizations have called for a global arms embargo for Myanmar, and protests continue nationwide.

**Emerging Stories -** Ocean liner schedules have been disrupted by the Civil Disobedience Movement. This follows news of disruptions at land borders, railways, and airports, demonstrating the ability of CDM to paralyze trade in Myanmar.
