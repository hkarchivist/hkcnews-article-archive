This is the summary for day 31 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 18 of consecutive internet blackouts. So far, nearly 1,500 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 62 have been killed by security forces since the beginning of the coup.

**Tatmadaw -** Tatmadaw forces cracked down on the ongoing nationwide protests with live fire across the country that left at least 38 dead in at least 4 cities with dozens more injured. The majority of deaths are now concentrated in Yangon, Mandalay, and Monywa. It is important to note that Mandalay and Monywa have declared themselves self-administered cities not answerable to the military junta and multiple townships in Yangon have done the same.

A significant portion of the killings from shots to the head, indicating that security forces are intentionally trying to cause fear among the protestors. As in other days in the last week, both police and military forces are on the ground.

There have also been reports of medics and their vehicles being targeted, with footage emerging yesterday of medics being pulled from an ambulance and being subject to beatings by security forces. A funeral home that provides services to the poor was also raided by security forces.

**CDM -** As the violence escalates, security forces have begun to defect from the Tatmadaw - at least 5 soldiers and 100 police officers. The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a body of elected MPs have announced their recognition of the township committees that have announced their allegiance to CRPH, building the momentum of the parallel governmental structures that CRPH is trying to create.

The UN envoy appointed by the elected government before the coup, Kyaw Moe Tun, and then fired by the junta after he declared his loyalty to CRPH, declared that he will remain in his position regardless of the military regime’s announcement. The person the junta tried to replace Kyaw Moe Tun with has turned down the role and resigned from her position.
