Just a day after the passing of Ma Thwe Thwe Khine, at least two more protestors were killed by security forces in Mandalay and one night watch volunteer was reported to have been killed in Yangon by police. It was also [Chin National Day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210221033746/https://unpo.org/article/15528) , a day which celebrates democracy, self-determination, and Chin identity. This celebration was banned for decades during military rule, and this year's celebration saw a delegation of 500 gather to oppose the coup. The current struggle in Myanmar is not just freedom from military oppression but also freedom from Bamar-Buddhist dominance.

**Tatmadaw Response -** Security forces killed two people in Mandalay after a day long standoff with protestors trying to protect striking workers from being forced back to work. After initially using rubber bullets, security forces opened fire on the crowds killing 2 and injuring dozens. One of the people killed was a teenager.

The 33rd Light Infantry Division, infamous for their involvement in the brutal violence against the Rohingya that caused over 700,000 to flee to Bangladesh in 2016, was reportedly involved in the shooting.

In Yangon, a night watch volunteer was shot and killed, and witnesses state that the shooter arrived and left in a police vehicle. One of Myanmar’s most famous actors, Lu Min, was arrested in a night raid after expressing his support for the Civil Disobedience Movement.

The head of Myanmar’s COVID vaccination program is now wanted and her team is on strike. She wrote a public letter stating that she feared that the vaccine would be used by the Tatmadaw to break CDM.

**CDM -** Nationwide protests continue and they continue to be creative and fun despite the increasing death toll and violent response from security forces. At one protest, demonstrators began providing free car washing services in order to keep the traffic impeded. Calls for sanctions and boycotts continue.

A letter was delivered to the EU calling for targeted sanctions, and the largest garment workers’ union called on brands like Calvin Kline to support striking workers, denounce the coup, and stop working with military affiliated factories.

The Ethnic Armed Organizations have pulled out of the National Ceasefire Agreement and voiced their support for CDM. This means that the movement potentially has weapons and people trained to use them in their camp, though it is currently unlikely this be a part of CDM strategy.

The Gender Equality Network, a huge network of gender and sexuality focused organizations, have pulled out of their relationships with government ministries. These sorts of groups were illegal under previous military rule.

**Things to keep an eye on -** A huge cache of data has been leaked from Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration. This is the biggest data leak regarding Myanmar to date, and could potentially be used to map out the vast financial connections of the military and it’s members.

Myanmar businesses also seem to be wary of the new regime, likely due to a combination of the speed at which they are passing and amending laws and the fervor of CDM participants to shame and boycott brands they see as accepting of the coup. Japan and Singapore have also signaled some displeasure with the regime - important as these countries have been investing heavily in Myanmar in the past few years even when others pulled back over human rights concerns.
