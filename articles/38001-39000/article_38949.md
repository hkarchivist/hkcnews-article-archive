# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 34

This is the summary for day 34 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 21 of consecutive internet blackouts.

So far at least 1758 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 63 have been killed by security forces. The big stories of the day are the night raids that resulted in the arrests of government workers participating in the #CivilDisobedienceMovement and the meeting of representatives from the committee representing elected lawmakers and Karen, Shan, and Chin leaders.

**Tatmadaw -** The night raids continued, and security forces were reported to have fired bullets (likely rubber) and stun grenades in multiple parts of Yangon in search of ward administrators, election officials, activists, and others involved in expressing dissent against the junta.

The regime also asked Indian officials to return police officers who have fled over the border in recent days, saying that they cannot obey regime orders, back to Myanmar. The military has also [hired a lobbying firm](https://web.archive.org/web/20210323201720/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-lobbyist-idUSKBN2AY0K0) to improve their image abroad. Despite dismissing the impact of sanctions in prior days, it has been confirmed that one of the tasks of the lobbying firm is to try and have sanctions on Myanmar lifted.

**CDM -** Protests continued throughout the country, and were largely able to proceed with a marked decrease in violence from security forces in comparison to previous days. Police in Yangon continued to use tear gas and stun grenades to disperse gathered crowds, but reports from various parts of the country show that many managed to gather without violent dispersal by police and soldiers.

This change follows orders published in state run media for security forces to refrain from using live ammunition. It is unclear how long this respite from mass casualties will last.

The cCommittee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, a body representing elected MPs, announced that all townships in Yangon and Magway have formed people’s governing bodies, meaning that over 10 million Myanmar people now live in areas with civilian and military governments vying for authority and loyalty.

CRPH representatives have also been meeting with Chin, Karen, and Shan leaders, signaling the Bamar and NLD dominated body is at least interested in speaking with ethnic minorities, many of whom did not vote for the NLD.
