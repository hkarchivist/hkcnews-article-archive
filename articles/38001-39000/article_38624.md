# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 27

This is the summary for day 27 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 14 of internet blackouts. So far 854 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced. The big stories of the day are the increased violent methods by which security forces have responded to protests and the shooting of a woman in Monywa - the city that declared itself independent of military rule on day 26.

**Tatmadaw -** Day 27 saw a large escalation of violence in the cities of Monywa and Yangon, with videos and photos of violence against women especially going viral. At least one woman was shot, though it is unclear if she has died at this point, and there were photos of police accosting a pregnant woman.

Though protests and violent crackdowns continued nationwide, Yangon and Monywa seemed to get the brunt of the security response. At least 4 journalists were arrested, Including those wearing equipment clearly identifying themselves as press.

Day 27 saw the first use of tear gas, and multiple sources reported people in plain clothes working in concert with the police. The mood on the streets have gotten increasingly militant. The military regime also tried to fire the Myanmar's permanent representative to the UN, although they do not have the authority since the junta has not been recognized by the UN s Myanmar's good government.

**CDM -** In what is being celebrated as a demonstration of the power of the Civil Disobedience Movement, Australian energy giant, Woodside Energy, has said that they will withdraw their workers from Myanmar and reassess their future here just one week after it announced that it would continue business as usual. Organizers have called for another huge showing of people on Day 28, similar to that on the 2.2.2.2.2 protest. Day 27 saw some of the most violent crackdowns from security forces so far, and many are worried that Day 28 will be worse.
