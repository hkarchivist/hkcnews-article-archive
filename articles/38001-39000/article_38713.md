# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 29

This is the summary for day 29 of the #MyanmarCoup and night 16 of internet blackouts. So far over 1,132 people have been arrested, charged, or sentenced and at least 24 people are dead. The big stories of the day are new charges levied against Aung San Suu Kyi and nighttime raid and arrest of a journalist.

**Tatmadaw -** The military spent day 29 of the coup trying to consolidate their power. Aung San Suu Kyi was charged with two additional charges, related to communications and incitement, on a video call into court. Her lawyer has still not been allowed power of attorney, but said that she looked like she was in good health on the video.

The junta also announced that they are recalling 100 staff members from foreign missions following the public show of defiance by Myanmar's permanent representative to the UN.

Security forces also raided the home of a DVB journalist at 10:30 pm and arrested him. At least 25 journalists have been arrested since the beginning of the coup.

**CDM -** Despite the bloodshed of day 28, protestors once again took to the streets. Memorials were built and funerals were held for the fallen. The CRPH declared the military to be a terrorist organization. Day 29 also saw the highest ranking police defection so far. A police major from Special Branch, an intelligence branch notorious in Myanmar, defected and is now in hiding.

**Emerging Stories -** The UN Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar said the military's actions in recent days "may amount to serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity".
