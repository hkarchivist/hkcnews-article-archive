# #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar - Day 22

This is the summary for day 22 of the #MyanmarCoup, day 16 of protests and night 9 of internet blackouts.

Millions took to the streets for the general strike in the largest day of protest so far, despite ominous warnings from the military and the killing of two protestors just the day before. Many were arrested but luckily the bloody crackdown that many feared did not happen.

**Tatmadaw Response -** Day 22 saw the largest crowds since the beginning of the coup, with reports of protests from every corner of the country. The night before the Tatmadaw had put out warnings that lives would be lost if protests continued, but the protests remained largely peaceful.

The official number of those taken as political prisoners compiled by the Association of Assistance for Political Prisoners is now 684, though that number is likely higher due to the high number of arrests yesterday - especially in the areas around the capitol. We also learned yesterday that Yangon police have refused to open a case into the shooting of a night watch volunteer. Witnesses say they suspect it was a police officer who killed the man.

**CDM -** The focus of the Civil Disobedience Movement is split between national actions and shaping the actions of the international committee. While the strike and protests were going on, the CRPH, a committee representing elected members of parliament, nominated a new UN representative, meaning the UN must now choose whether they will recognize the representative from this committee or the one from the junta.

200 civil society organizations signed a letter calling for international financial institutions to freeze Myanmar junta assets and recall loans for any military linked institutions. Another emerging leadership group, a multi-ethnic body called the General Strike Committee of Nationalities, sent a letter to the Chinese ambassador to Myanmar urging China to work with the anti-coup movement and not provide support to the junta.

**Emerging Stories -** Facebook has taken down the main page for the state-run television news channel, but others remain up. The Tatmadaw spokesperson also has multiple profiles despite being banned from the platform. Unless Facebook changes its tactics and gets more expertise on the players involved, they will be playing a losing game of cat and mouse forever.

The business community has signed a letter supporting rule of law. The EU Council has condemned the coup and called for the restoration of the elected government, but has not laid out any actions they will take to enforce their call. On the other hand, Malaysia is pushing fellow ASEAN nations to agree on an action plan to hold the junta to their promise of an election in the future, a move rejected by most in Myanmar as capitulating to the regime.
