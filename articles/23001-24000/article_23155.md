# Lord Patten full interview


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210727221200if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMYINobkboE" >}}


Traditional wisdom has it that it is better late than never. Last governor Lord Patten has said it was not too late for Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor to find a political settlement to the political crisis sparked by the now-suspended extradition bill.

He said that in an interview with CitizenNews at his residence in the suburb of London in the middle of July. Citing his experience in leading an inquiry on policing in Northern Ireland in 1998 and 1999, he said an independent commission to probe the protests would not just find help out truth, but heal the wounds of the society.

His views, carried in a Chinese article published last month（ [彭定康專訪：林鄭救局仍未太遲](https://web.archive.org/web/20210727221200/https://bit.ly/2K18Mw9) ）, remain valid now as it was then. That the video of his full interview is only published now is not by design, but due to technical hiccups in the production process.

The 40-minute minute interview was conducted at the dining room with portraits of his team of staff at the Government House, where he bade farewell on June 30, 1997.

In the interview, he made no bones about his dislike of the Chinese Communist Party and United States President Donald Trump.

Lord Patten said: "What is the latest thing Trump has done? Apparently, he's told President Xi that he's not going to make a fuss about Xinjiang, or about Hong Kong, provided China gives some ground on trade talks. It is lamentable. This is supposed to be the leader of the free world, and he behaves like a … well, I'd better not say."

On China, he is adamant foreign government should not bow to Chinese pressure. "If you allow China to bully you, you can't be surprised that it goes on bullying you. And for what? You are not going to do more trade with China because we kowtow. If the Chinese want to buy our things, they will."

Serena Lam Tsz-nga and Adrian Yeung have assisted in the shooting and production of the Patten interview video.
