# The Hong Kong Way


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210630043929if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLNThQe9FcY" >}}


**By Florence**   
   
 Before "Glory to Hong Kong" became almost ubiquitous, on the New York protest trails there was often Hong Kong's long-time favorite 《海闊天空》(I call it "Broad Expanse Wide and Deep". Other translated versions bear different names). Music by Beyond, written by Wong Ka Kui, the band's "soul" in song writing, singing and guitar performance.

"The Hong Kong Way", however, is not the English translation from its original Chinese lyrics. But a new piece on its own.   
   
 We fight for freedom when it vanished. We resist authoritarianism and are labeled wild and feisty by the "established" echelons who favor status quo. The timelessness of Beyond's music lies in the spirit of this unyielding resistance that echoes through generations. I clad this classic music with new English lyrics to commemorate the unprecedented resistance movement in Hong Kong that started from the anti-extradition bill movement in June 2019. Non-commerical in nature. I hope Beyond wouldn't mind. With naught resources at best, thanks to Kayser who played a jack of all trades, this finally goes live. Please pardon the singing, and listen to the words…….

I think "The Hong Kong Way" means more than the Hong Kong people's adaptation of "The Baltic Way" 30 years ago, a human chain formed by 2 million people from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania calling for freedom. Here, 2 million Hongkongers took to the streets, and countless protesters fill the streets and paths and parks and schools and slopes and hills….in the form of human chains. Quietly we stand, strangers next to each other, connected in hands and hearts, for the same firm cause.   
   
 It compliments the confrontations that are often more violent and dangerous. In the face of China's intimating encroachment, and increasingly emboldened Hong Kong's riot police who collaborated with triad gangsters to brutally beat up people; and who suppress protesters with tear gases, pepper spray, water tanks, rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and recently real guns, Hongkongers bravely fight back but with severe casualty: their limbs twisted and broken, their eyes shot blind, some even killed and disposed as "suicidal" cases….and the cold-blooded cruel crackdown still underway.   
   
 The Hong Kong "Way" also means a unique Hong Kong style, just like the city's famously classic milk tea, wonton noodles, diners… While protests are common in human history, the Hongkongers shock the whole world as the most resilient, the most creative, the quickest and the most determined breed of protesters, swiftly flowing and transforming like water. Their impeccable humor sustains the toughest times; their tacit unity precedes all hardships.   
   
 Standing at the forefront of this fight against the behemoth communist authoritarian power of China are the bravest, the most determined, and yet the most disciplined, polite, clean and shy people who are also prepared to sacrifice their own lives for the betterment of Hong Kong's future.   
   
 Their consensual final meeting place when all ends is called the "Pot Base", the protest area beneath the oval-shaped Legislative Council Complex: uniquely coded in the Hong Kong way! And this could be the biggest commitment the Hongkongers ever made!

Over 100 days of resistance in sweat and blood. And counting. Streets filled with the fearless, and the fearful. Yet they fear not of their own safety, but of losing their fellow fighters. They fear not of losing their own lives, but of leaving behind family and loved ones. They are prepared to lose 10 years of their young lives in jail; they would rather be arrested if they could save those who were gunned down……. They fight for freedom; but are ready to give up their own, even their lives. Don't forget whose sacrifice and courage halted the passage of the extradition bill amendments.   
   
 The pathway of resistance may be rugged with unknowns; but protesters' focus on the cause and determination has never shaken. These are the Hongkongers.   
   
 Dying as sacrifice is not a romantic notion. It's utmost nobility with a clear vision that personal existence can subside to collective good and universal values. With nothing beyond it, "being" can, though light, be unbearable.

 This song is dedicated to those who fight hard to protect Hong Kong, in the teary, sweaty and bloody long battles.   
   
 This is particularly dedicated to the frontline fighters - the bravest, and inevitably the most hurt. You may be nameless or faceless beneath your gear in the misty tear-gassed streets; you may even have perished, prematurely, in the most senseless brutal ways one can imagine. But the whole world has seen your courage. How you live what you learned in your youth. How you handled dangers with wit and courage and humility and determination. How you bear the present and the future and all the plights of the city on your own shoulders at such a young age. How you showed your deep love for this place you call home.

Around the world, we are all so, so deeply, touched.

**The Hong Kong Way (Lyrics)**

I wonder   
 What the world is meant to be.   
 Where is justice? Truth? And freedom? Honesty?   
 Broken promises.   
 Dreams are shattered in pieces.   
 How we want to write our own   
 History. (Our destiny)

Follow me…   
 Let us be water, my friend.   
 Fight the bullets, tear gas, batons, pepper spray.   
 Broken umbrellas.   
 Tears and fear beneath my gear.   
 Final words and all my past.   
 Not a name. (No face, no name)

I wonder   
 What the world is meant to be.   
 Where is justice? Truth? And freedom? Honesty?   
 Broken promises.   
 Dreams are shattered in pieces.   
 How we want to write our own   
 History.

In the sweat and blood we fight, as love will lift us all.   
 Our voices and dreams on the Lennon Wall.   
 We have lost our eyes. We have lost our lives.   
 We will never, never cease to try.

(MUSIC)

On the pathway unknown,   
 We are never alone.   
 The Hong Kong Way.

And when someday somewhere ever shall we meet again,   
 I will show you my true face and embrace.   
 In the hands and hearts.   
 In the human chain.   
 I will smile to you on our date.

In the hands and hearts.   
 In The Hong Kong Way.   
 Hallelujah!   
 See you on this day!

(FINAL CHORUS)

And when someday somewhere ever shall we meet again,   
 I will show you my true face and embrace.   
 In the hands and hearts.   
 In The Hong Kong Way.

Hallelujah!   
 See you on THIS day!
