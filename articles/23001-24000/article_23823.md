雨傘運動五周年，民陣今天晚上在添馬公園舉行集會，集會提前於晚上八點半結束。民陣召集人岑子杰在結束前宣讀民陣宣言：

2014年的今天—9月28日—梁振英政府在夏愨道向示威市民發射87枚催淚彈，促成79日的雨傘運動。有民調顯示，香港有120萬人參與過雨傘運動。

雨傘運動是爭取「真普選」的運動，希望我們有一個有平等參選權、平等提名權、平等投票權、平等當選權的特首普選。毫無疑問，過了五年，我們現在還未落實到「真普選」。

很多人都指雨傘運動是失敗告終。而然，我們曾經支持過、參與過的雨傘運動，又是否真的一事無成？

今年是9.28五周年，過去5年是怎樣的日子呢？我問過很多人，會怎樣形容這五年的時光，很多人都說很「無力」、「看不見希望」，尤其是在「魚蛋運動」之後，很多人都感到「和理非」無用、「勇武」亦不能成功，「佔中九子」和「魚蛋義士」都被控入獄，香港好像已經沒有出路。

在這份「看不見希望」和「無力感」當中，我們過了五年，沒有大型示威，特區政府DQ議員、通過「一地兩檢」，明目張膽地將壞事做盡。沒有人想到五年之後，林鄭月娥和保皇黨用極醜惡和毫不修飾的手法，硬推「送中條例」，最終竟然引發今天這一場運動。

這場反送中運動當中，6月9日有103萬人上街、6月16日200萬人上街，8月18日超過170萬人上街。香港竟然在短短幾個月之內，接連3次過百萬人上街。上百萬人上街，固然是因為林鄭的傲慢和無能所觸法，但更重要的是，經歷過雨傘運動、曾經走上街頭的市民，今天再次重新抗爭，加上在「反送中運動」覺醒的新一代，香港人創做出三分一市民「抵抗暴政，爭取民主」的浩瀚場面，2014年的5年後，再一次震撼全球。

過去5年，我們的確有很多人感到「無力」、「看不見希望」，但在雨傘運動中醒來的人，我們都沒有再次沉睡，反而在「反送中運動」中再次站起來，和更有活力、更聰明的新一代抵抗林鄭和中共的壓逼。這五年，我們吸取了「雨傘運動」和「魚蛋運動」的不足，演變出更團結、更靈活的示威方式，令林鄭終於「撤回惡法」。五大訴求還未全面落實，我們不會宣佈運動成功，但最少，我們在「雨傘運動」、「魚蛋運動」中吸取了寶貴的經驗，令我們距離成功愈來愈近。

「不篤灰、不割蓆、不分化」不是一句口號，而是這五年來，我們學到的其中一個寶貴的經驗。這場運動，我們必然會堅持下去，而且是更有智慧的堅持下去：「五大訴求，缺一不可」！

社會運動，從來都是一幕幕連續不斷的故事，我們立足的時間點，永遠都只是這部精彩故事的其中一個段落，200萬人不過是一個等待被打破的紀錄接下來的章節必定更精彩！

讓我們記得：我們香港人用生命在寫的這的個故事的名字叫做 「我要真普選」！

香港人，加油！

**Declaration on 5th Anniversary of Umbrella Movement**

Five years ago, on this very same day, the 28th of September, CY Leung's Government shot 87 tear gas bombs to Hong Kong people in the Harcourt Road, Admiralty, marking the start of 79 days of the Umbrella Movement. Polls show that 1.2 million Hong Kong people had participated in the Umbrella Movement.

The aim of Umbrella Movement was to fight for a genuine universal suffrage, including the right to nominate, right to elect and right to be elected.

Unfortunately, 5 years have passed, and we still don't have the real universal suffrage.

Some people described that the Umbrella Movement ended in failure. But is it true that the movement that we all supported and participated in, had achieved nothing?

We've asked a lot of people, how would they describe the last five years. A lot of them said: "powerless" and "hopeless".

Especially after the "Fishball Movement", many people thought that "peaceful" protests no longer work, and "brave" protests could not succeed.

LEADERS of BOTH Umbrella AND Fishball movement were jailed. Hong Kong seemed to be facing a dead end.

We spent 5 years soaked in these hopelessness and powerlessness. Without mass protests, the HKSAR Government disqualified lawmakers, passed evil laws, and had done all the unimaginable things to destroy our system.

No one would have thought that, in 2019, another evil bill, the Extradition Bill, that was so blatantly and daringly attempted to be pushed through by Carrie Lam and pro-Beijing lawmakers, would start this huge "Anti-Extradition Bill Movement".

Since June this year, 1 million, then 2 million, then again 1.7 million people took to the street in just three-month period. Surely, it is because of the arrogance and inability of Carrie Lam's Government. But more importantly, it is because of YOU, who had participated in the Umbrella Movement, who had stayed with us in those 79 days, decided TO BE BACK to the streets again.

Together with the new generation of young protesters who were inspired to join this year, we created marvellous scenes of almost ONE-THIRD of our whole population came out to "fight against the tyranny and for democracy". Five years after the Umbrella Movement, Hong Kong people once again made ourselves proud, and amazed the world.

We EVOLVED from the hopelessness and powerlessness, and stand up again STRONGER. Our new generation of protesters are wiser, smarter, with more energy and strategies, bravely resisting the persecution of Beijing and HK Governments.

We LEARNT from both Umbrella Movement and Fishball Movement, and EVOLVED to a new form of protest that is more united, more flexible, and finally SUCCESSFUL MADE Carrie LAM to withdraw the Extradition Bill.

However, "Five Demands, not one less". As our five demands are not all heard and responded, WE CANNOT CLAIM THIS MOVEMENT SUCCESSFUL. But we are closer.

"NOT SPLITTING, STAY UNITED" is not only a slogan, but wisdom that evolved from our valuable past.

Social movement is created by stories after stories written by us. What we are facing NOW is only one chapter, 2 million is only a record waiting to be broken. The next chapter WILL ONLY BE BETTER AND BRIGHTER.

Let’s continue to fight for REAL UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE. Fight for ALL 5 DEMANDS.

香港人加油，Hongkongers, soldier on!
