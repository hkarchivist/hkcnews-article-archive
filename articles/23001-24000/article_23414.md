# Supporting HKG from YYZ… on September 2, 2019

On the past Monday, September 2, Torontonians had another march and rally to support Hong Kong freedom fighters and condemn HK police’s excessive use of violence.

A Canadian national statutory holiday known as the Labour Day, it is the last day of the last long weekend before school resumes. It is a much-treasured day for Canadians, and it was also an emotional day for many who went downtown Toronto to march and rally for HKers.

Police brutality

HKers, not just freedom fighters, are facing horrendous moments. There is an increasingly alarming rise of police hatred against HKers. HK Police, on August 31, stormed the Prince Edward subway station and re-enacted the July 21 Yuen Long mass assault against HK citizens by white-dressed thugs, only this time, the Police took the indiscrimatory beating offer up themselves.

A 62 years old drunken senior, not even anti-ELAB related, exposed a terrifying 20-minute long of major physical abuse by policemen when he was hospitalized and chained in a bed in a special ward when the assaulting cops thought there was no video surveillance equipment in the enclosed room.

#MeToo victims mustered up their courage to speak on their sexual harassment experiences under police custody.

Arrested people were observed to be walking onto the transferring vehicle ok, but some got admitted into hospitals with suspected hemorrhage and multiple fracture thereafter. There have been numerous cases of serious injuries and doubtful arrests against passersby, student leaders, medical staff, journalists, social workers and even HK’s lawmakers, not just radical protesters.

Anyone who slows the police down from unleashing their uncontrollable anger seems to be targeted for retaliation. The police hatred, spread like a plague, drove Simon Southgate, new to the post as an Assistant Commander for the Tsuen Wan district, to release an email asking his comrades not to address protesters as cockroaches (1).

When peaceful means of freedom requests are brutally shut off by the HK government, it becomes more apparent that international support must escalate their width and effectiveness.

The September 2 march and rally in Toronto

The march and the rally went back to back. The march,《831落閘五年多倫多聲援遊行》, was organized by two new faces. The rally,《落閘五年 8.31全球聲援集會》, was hosted by the veteran group, Canada-Hong Kong Link. Both were in commemoration of the “August 31 decision” five years ago in HK, "落閘五年". Five years ago, Beijing tried to sell HKers a plan for fake universal suffrage. Some HKers described that plan as “giving HKers a choice of having ‘poop-tasted curry’, or ‘curry-like poop’”. This lead to the “Occupy Central Movement” where occupation of city streets lasted 79 days.

It was a much cooler day than the last rally at the Old Queen’s Park on Aug 17. There was no pro-China camp disturbance. No sports cars. No violence (2). The march and rally went as planned this time.

Most people were dressed in black, some with masks, construction helmets, and eye patch. The red maple leaf was seen on flags, hats and clothes. Many new over-sized posters were printed. A local artist painted many framed signs by reusing her old canvasses.

  
 Signs and banners.

The walk took one lane of Bloor. Many drivers along Bloor gave support to HK by giving their thumbs up and honking in rhythms. The matching crowd cheered and waved back.

I saw demonstrators in a wide age spectrum. Some young families brought their kids along. A little boy led some chanting, and then his voice got a little cracked. But he kept trying and his parents let him. People embrace such lifelong life teachings and life lessons.

  
 Everyone did their part. These young siblings delivered no half-baked jobs here!

  
 Four adults, three kids, two families, one mind: Stand with Hong Kong!

Many OPP officers guarded the march route and RCMP officers on horse back tended the rally site. I felt really safe; hence felt particularly sorry for HK.

The organizer got more international friends supporting HK, from East Turkistan/Tibet, Vietnam and China (yes, China). Beautiful speeches. The new organizers of the walk also read the joint statement (3) to condemn the 8.31 police violence. The statement was co-signed by 21 different organizations geographically from Canada, HK, US, Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, New Zealand and virtually from LIHKG and Freedom Hong Kong.

 Grow the support alliance!

There are over 300,000 Canadian expats in HK officially.  Unofficially, there may be up to 500,000.  Canadians with HK ties, whether that be families, friends, studies, work, business, just living or simply retiring, will do a lot more to move the government in this up-coming election.

Labour Day marks the end of summer for Canada.  But be rest assured, this is only the beginning for this mission.  We stand with Hong Kong.  God is with us, and we shall overcome!

Some slogans used:

Say No to China Infiltration in Canada!   Free 2 Michaels!  Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong!   Free Hong Kong!

「香港警察 知法犯法」 「香港人 加油」「林鄭 下台」「沒有暴徒  只有暴政」「光復香港  時代革命」
