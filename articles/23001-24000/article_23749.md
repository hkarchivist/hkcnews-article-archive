「各位香港兄弟姊妹，多謝您哋繼續堅持，好對唔住我無法同您哋一齊打落去。

如果再比我揀一次，我唔想做逃兵，好想同大家一齊為死去嘅手足報仇，一齊贏，一齊喺煲底相擁，一齊唱國歌。

身處異鄉，感覺係個外人，身邊好陌生，好掛住香港，唔想各位兄弟姊妹好似我咁流離失所。但好多謝您哋嘅幫手，放心我會照顧好自己，唔會成為大家嘅負累。

對唔住要您哋努力埋我嗰份，希望大家記住每一位新屋嶺、太子站同被自殺嘅義士，正如天琦所講「黎明之前嘅黑暗，係至黑暗嘅。真係好黑暗，但係黎明即將會來臨。」

我同您哋都好驚，但更加驚被害受辱嘅手足一直含冤，求求大家企出嚟同前線一齊為手足們伸冤！

黎明來到　要光復　這香港

同行兒女　為正義　時代革命

光復香港，時代革命！

**英文翻譯版**

Fellow brothers and sisters in Hong Kong, thank you for still having my back, and sorry for not being able to fight on with you.

If I could choose again, I would not take the path of a deserter again. I really just want to avenge our fallen heroes with everyone, and win this fight together, and hold you all tight underneath LegCo, crying and singing our new anthem together.

Being abroad makes me feel like I don’t belong anywhere; nothing familiar enters my eyes; I miss Hong Kong terribly. I hope that no one would have to roam around a foreign place like me. But I genuinely thank you for all your help. Please rest assured that I will take good care of myself, and not be a burden to you.

I hate to have to offload my part of the responsibility onto you, but I hope that everyone can bear the martyrs from San Uk Lang and Prince Edward, and those who were murdered for knowing the truth, in mind in the coming days, and heed Edward Leung’s words: ‘The darkness before dawn is the darkest of all - but it means that the dawn will shortly break.’

Please know that I feel all your fears and that I am with you, but I know that we also cannot bear to see the wrongfully convicted never having the chance to vindicate themselves, I beg all of you to please step out with the frontliners and make sure that justice is done!

‘We shall re-enlighten Hong Kong when dawn comes.

For justice, we shall walk arm-in-arm in this epochal revolution.’

Liberate Hong Kong,

Revolution of our time!
