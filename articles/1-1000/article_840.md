A Whiter Shade Of Pale - Procol Harum

We skipped the light fandango   
 Turned cartwheels cross the floor   
 I was feeling kinda seasick   
 But the crowd called out for more   
 The room was humming harder   
 As the ceiling flew away   
 When we called out for another drink   
 The waiter brought a tray

[Chorus]   
 And so it was that later   
 As the miller told his tale   
 That her face, at first just ghostly,   
 Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said, there is no reason   
 And the truth is plain to see.   
 But I wandered through my playing cards   
 And would not let her be   
 One of sixteen vestal virgins   
 Who were leaving for the coast   
 And although my eyes were open   
 They might have just as well've been closed

She said, I'm home on shore leave,   
 Though in truth we were at sea   
 So I took her by the looking glass   
 And forced her to agree   
 Saying, you must be the mermaid   
 Who took Neptune for a ride.   
 But she smiled at me so sadly   
 That my anger straightway died

If music be the food of love   
 Then laughter is its queen   
 And likewise if behind is in front   
 Then dirt in truth is clean   
 My mouth by then like cardboard   
 Seemed to slip straight through my head   
 So we crash-dived straightway quickly   
 And attacked the ocean bed

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
