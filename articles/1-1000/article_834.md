The Animals - The House of the Rising Sun Mafia III Trailer 3 Casino !!!

There is a house in New Orleans   
 They call the Rising Sun   
 And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy   
 And God, I know I'm one

My mother was a tailor   
 She sewed my new blue jeans   
 My father was a gamblin' man   
 Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs   
 Is a suitcase and trunk   
 And the only time he's satisfied   
 Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother, tell your children   
 Not to do what I have done   
 Spend your lives in sin and misery   
 In the House of the Rising Sun

Well, I got one foot on the platform   
 The other foot on the train   
 I'm goin' back to New Orleans   
 To wear that ball and chain

Well, there is a house in New Orleans   
 They call the Rising Sun   
 And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy   
 And God, I know I'm one

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
