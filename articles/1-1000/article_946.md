# Former Hong Kong Journalist comments on Claire Hollingworth and Donald Trump

I haven't lived in Hong Kong for many years, but two recent events bring me back to this special territory.

The death of Claire Hollingworth struck me deeply. Frankly, I was amazed she had lived so long. But news of her demise reminded me of the times when I had the privilege of reading newspapers to her. I certainly wasn’t the only one who did this but it was a special treat to spend time with her and encourage her to reminisce about her career.

But the most urgent matter on my mind right now that reminds me of Hong Kong is the disastrous election of Donald Trump as the next US president.

Freedoms that I had taken for granted would be stable in the United States for the rest of my life and for the future now see fragile and temporary.

I remember walking down Queens Road in demonstrations urging the Legislative Council to uphold the freedoms written in the Basic Law. Today from where I live in San Francisco, I take special note of any news coverage of protests for greater democracy in the Special Administrative Region. And while once Hong Kong's marches of democratic fervor filled me with compassion, now I identify with them ever more strongly. Never did I think I'd feel it necessary to participate in actions supporting such ideals in my own country.

So many things on my mind right now. So much upsets me about this individual and his circle, I don't know where to start. Women's rights – the Senate just removed key provisions of health care for women.

I am enthusiastic about the Women's march on Jan 21, protesting new administration. There are dozens of US citizens that are having such marches on the same day. I'm going to the march in San Francisco.

The isolation of Muslims in our country troubles me and I have asked my spiritual community to reach out to some Muslim congregations in a meaningful way. It's under consideration. We'll see whether and how it happens.

I would love to communicate with Hong Kong people.

Warmly, Francine Brevetti
