# Who’s smashing the pillars?

Are you a Netflix fan? Do you follow Netflix series?

“Izzy’s Koala World”, filmed in North Queensland, Australia, will premiere on Netflix on 15th September 2020 - by the time you’re reading this article, the series may have premiered.

What’s it about?

It’s about a 12 year old Aussie, who landed her very own Netflix series alongside her veterinarian mum as they rescue and rehabilitate sick, injured and orphaned koalas.

Yup, a 12 year old girl. Now, look at what happened to a 12 year old girl who was arrested a week ago, in Hong Kong.

It’s been days..... I have been waiting for organizations such as Hong Kong Society for the Protection of Children (HKSPC) to take some sort of actions; but to my disappointment, there’s none.....

What on earth is going on???

Green objects rugby-tackled her to the ground - a girl who was NOT taking part in the protest that day, she was on her way to get art supplies. She got spooked by the police and tried to hurry away, guess what happened to her? Green objects chased after her and tackled her to the ground - one of the green objects forced her down to the ground by kneeling on her waist: according to a chiropractor’s opinion, that could damage her back in a serious way.

Goodness... she’s just a little girl, a minor, unarmed kiddo.... couldn’t those green objects simply stop her without tackling her to the ground?

Children are the pillars of the society’s future, is our government trying to smash our pillars? Probably......
