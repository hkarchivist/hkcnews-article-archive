# I’m lost……

The Geneva convention states this: at all times, and particularly after an engagement, parties to the conflict shall, without delay, take all possible measures … to ensure … adequate care of the wounded and sick. They shall not wilfully be left without medical assistance and care, nor shall conditions exposing them to contagion or infection be created.…….. In all circumstances they shall be treated humanely and shall receive, to the fullest extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the medical care and attention required by their condition.

Wonder if those green objects respect the above…

A number of upsetting news pop up daily, I have been trying my very best not to read any local news: allow me, I really can’t take it anymore… I start questioning myself, is this really Hong Kong? How come it looks so unfamiliar? I thought the HKSAR government observes the law & respects humanity? Or is it just my hallucination?

On 31st August 2019, passengers in the metro were brutally attacked by the police.

A survivor told the press this: I was on the metro, I saw at least 20 policemen on the Prince Edward Metro Station platform when suddenly five or six ran into my carriage.

“Everyone started to scream ‘they are coming, they’re insane,” he said. “They kept moving and hitting everyone in the compartments. I started running. I saw police using their batons to keep hitting the same person on the head, even though he was kneeling down in the corner.”

Video footage showed police pepper spraying on protesters inside the train car, chasing and arresting others on the train platform and ordering them to kneel against a wall with their hands on the heads. One man could be seen bleeding from the head – without any medical treatment: medics were blocked from offering medical assistance, though they were pleading/begging those heartless green objects.

A year later, people went to Prince Edward Metro Station to pay their condolences – some of them got tickets for violation of social-distancing rules, some of them got tickets for littering: placing flowers on the ground outside of Prince Edward Metro Station. Well………………..

A couple of hours before the midnight, something ridiculous happened: while citizens were trying to help a heavily pregnant woman from being pulled away by green objects, that woman was dragged to the ground by one of the green objects – a green object who was locking her neck while dragging her down. The woman’s husband screamed & cried for help, but guess what? Green objects shut him up by spraying pepper spray on him, targeting at his eyes.

What on earth is happening in Hong Kong??? I am lost……
