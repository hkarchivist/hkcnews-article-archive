# 我的周末歌單25─Princess Diana Funeral - Elton John - Candle In The Wind

[Verse 1]   
 Goodbye England's rose   
 May you ever grow in our hearts   
 You were the grace that placed itself   
 Where lives were torn apart   
 You called out to our country   
 And you whispered to those in pain   
 Now you belong to heaven   
 And the stars spell out your name

[Chorus]   
 And it seems to me you lived your life   
 Like a candle in the wind   
 Never fading with the sunset   
 When the rain set in   
 And your footsteps will always fall here   
 Along England's greenest hills   
 Your candle's burned out long before   
 Your legend ever will

[Verse 2]   
 Loveliness we've lost   
 These empty days without your smile   
 This torch, we'll always carry   
 For our nation's golden child   
 And even though we try   
 The truth brings us to tears   
 All our words cannot express   
 The joy you brought us through the years

[Verse 3]   
 Goodbye England's rose   
 May you ever grow in our hearts   
 You were the grace that placed yourselves   
 Where lives were torn apart   
 Goodbye England's rose   
 From a country lost without your soul   
 Who'll miss the wings of your compassion   
 More than you will ever know

And your footsteps will always fall here   
 Along England's greenest hills   
 Your candle's burned out long before   
 Your legend ever will

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
