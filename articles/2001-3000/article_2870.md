# 我的周末歌單30－ Led Zeppelin - Stairway To Heaven (NOT LIVE) (Perfect Audio)


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326053328if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/IS6n2Hx9Ykk" >}}


There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold   
 And she's buying a stairway to heaven.   
 When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed   
 With a word she can get what she came for.   
 Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure   
 'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.   
 In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,   
 Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,   
 Ooh, it makes me wonder.

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,   
 And my spirit is crying for leaving.   
 In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,   
 And the voices of those who stand looking.

Ooh, it makes me wonder,   
 Ooh, it really makes me wonder.

And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,   
 Then the piper will lead us to reason.   
 And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,   
 And the forests will echo with laughter.

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,   
 It's just a spring clean for the May queen.   
 Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run   
 There's still time to change the road you're on.   
 And it makes me wonder.

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,   
 The piper's calling you to join him,   
 Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know   
 Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road   
 Our shadows taller than our soul.   
 There walks a lady we all know   
 Who shines white light and wants to show   
 How everything still turns to gold.   
 And if you listen very hard   
 The tune will come to you at last.   
 When all are one and one is all   
 To be a rock and not to roll.

And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
