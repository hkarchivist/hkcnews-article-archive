# 我的周末歌單23─New Order - Blue Monday

How does it feel   
 To treat me like you do   
 When you've laid laid your hands upon me   
 And told me who you are

I thought I was mistaken   
 I thought I heard your words   
 Tell me how do I feel   
 Tell me now how do I feel

Those who came before me   
 Lived through their vocations   
 From the past until completion   
 They will turn away no more

And I still find it so hard   
 To say what I need to say   
 But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me   
 Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor   
 I can and shall obey   
 But if it wasn't for your misfortunes   
 I'd be a heavenly person today

And I thought I was mistaken   
 And I thought I heard you speak   
 Tell me how do I feel   
 Tell me now how should I feel

Now I stand here waiting

I thought I told you to leave me   
 While I walked down to the beach   
 Tell me how does it feel   
 When your heart grows cold   
 (grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
