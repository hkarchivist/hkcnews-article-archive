# 我的周末歌單27─Carpenters Close To You


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326055335if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/6inwzOooXRU" >}}


Why do birds suddenly appear   
 Every time you are near?   
 Just like me, they long to be   
 Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky   
 Every time you walk by?   
 Just like me, they long to be   
 Close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together   
 And decided to create a dream come true   
 So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair   
 Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town   
 (Girls in town)   
 Follow you   
 (Follow you)   
 All around   
 (All around)   
 Just like me, they long to be   
 Close to you

That is why all the girls in town   
 (Girls in town)   
 Follow you   
 (Follow you)   
 All around   
 (All around)   
 Just like me, they long to be   
 Close to you   
 Just like me, they long to be   
 Close to you

(Why? Close to you)   
 (Why? Close to you)   
 (Haa, close to you)   
 (Why? Close to you)

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
