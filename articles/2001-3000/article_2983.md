# 'Healthier' alternatives to cigarettes can save many lives

By Eason Lau

Chief Executive CY Leung has announced in his 2017 Policy Address that the Government would study the proposal to regulate electronic cigarettes through legislation. The Food and Health Bureau has actually told the legislature more than once about its plan to regulate or even ban e-cigarettes.

I believe many people in Hong Kong have an impression that smoking e-cigarettes, or vaping, is as harmful as smoking traditional cigarettes, if not more harmful. We have been told by health officials and experts that e-cigarettes are evil, because given their wide range of different flavours, they can make lots of youngsters turn to smoking and serve as a gateway to real tobacco. Most local news reports focus on the explosions of vaping devices in overseas countries. There is barely any discussion about the actual health impact of e-cigarettes based on scientific researches.

While it may well be taboo in Hong Kong to advocate the potential advantages or reduced risks of certain cigarette products, consumers, particularly smokers, should not be deprived of the right to knowledge about what cigarette alternatives are out there that may have a lesser health impact or that may even help them quit smoking traditional cigarettes.

In 2015, Public Health England published an expert independent review which concludes that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful to health than tobacco cigarettes, and have the potential to help smokers quit smoking.

Last April, [the Royal College of Physicians in the UK released a report](https://web.archive.org/web/20210712004312/https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction-0) that dismissed a common misconception that vaping is dangerous, and encouraged smokers to switch to e-cigarettes.

In February, [a long-term study of the effects of vaping on ex-smokers](https://web.archive.org/web/20210712004312/https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0117/90217-e-cigarettes-safer-than-smoking) conducted by researchers led by Dr Lion Shahab at University College London has found that smokers who switched to artificial alternatives benefit from substantially lower exposure to toxins and carcinogens.

In fact, in addition to e-cigarettes, which heat a nicotine-infused liquid to create a vapour, tobacco companies are pursuing the development of new cigarette alternatives using the heat-not-burn technology. Among these heat-not-burn products is iQOS, produced by Philip Morris, which is said to heat real tobacco at 350 degrees Celsius rather than burn it, and produce a vapour that offers a similar experience to smoking. Since there is no combustion process, the product delivers nicotine without the harmful smoke of cigarettes, and is thus considered a much healthier alternative to smoking.

As one of the world's leading tobacco companies, Philip Morris also announced in January that over 1 million smokers around the world have converted to iQOS, and painted a vision of a "smoke-free future"– which will see traditional combustible cigarettes being replaced by smoke-free products one day.

Sceptics may be quick to dismiss the development of such next-generation cigarette alternatives as the tobacco industry's attempt to keep its business going in the face of the decline in the smoking population and sales of conventional cigarettes in developed markets due to high taxes and growing health concerns. Some may also find it difficult to believe a tobacco company that produces some 850 billion combustible cigarettes each year would look to phase out cigarettes.

However, despite our suspicion about the tobacco industry's motives, we should not turn a blind eye to the increasing number of studies that have proved the health benefits of cigarette alternatives. These products have been made possible by technological advancements only in recent years and should be made available to smokers who want to give up combustible cigarettes to improve their health.

The World Health Organisation estimates that there will be over 1 billion smokers by 2025 - despite campaigns to quit smoking. There are currently 650,000 smokers in Hong Kong alone. If smokers were given the opportunity to convert to healthier alternatives which deliver a satisfying experience as combustible cigarettes, many lives could be saved.

Our health officials may think that smokers should quit smoking completely and that cigarette alternatives with reduced health risks are not good enough. They have yet to open their mind to the next-generation alternatives to smoking, and should not let perfect be the enemy of good.
