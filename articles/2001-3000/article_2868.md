# 我的周末歌單28－The Who - Won't Get Fooled Again


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20170326055303if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYMD_W_r3Fg" >}}


We'll be fighting in the streets   
 With our children at our feet   
 And the morals that they worship will be gone   
 And the men who spurred us on   
 Sit in judgement of all wrong   
 They decide and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution   
 Take a bow for the new revolution   
 Smile and grin at the change all around   
 Pick up my guitar and play   
 Just like yesterday   
 Then I'll get on my knees and pray   
 We don't get fooled again

The change, it had to come   
 We knew it all along   
 We were liberated from the fold, that's all   
 And the world looks just the same   
 And history ain't changed   
 'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution   
 Take a bow for the new revolution   
 Smile and grin at the change all around   
 Pick up my guitar and play   
 Just like yesterday   
 Then I'll get on my knees and pray   
 We don't get fooled again   
 No, no!

I'll move myself and my family aside   
 If we happen to be left half alive   
 I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky   
 Though I know that the hypnotized never lie   
 Do ya?

There's nothing in the streets   
 Looks any different to me   
 And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye   
 And the parting on the left   
 Are now parting on the right   
 And the beards have all grown longer overnight

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution   
 Take a bow for the new revolution   
 Smile and grin at the change all around   
 Pick up my guitar and play   
 Just like yesterday   
 Then I'll get on my knees and pray   
 We don't get fooled again   
 Don't get fooled again   
 No, no!

Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Meet the new boss   
 Same as the old boss

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
