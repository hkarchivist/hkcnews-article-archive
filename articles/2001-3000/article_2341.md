# 我的周末歌單20--Art Garfunkel - Bridge Over Troubled Water


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701152946if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_a46WJ1viA" >}}


When you're weary, feeling small,   
 When tears are in your eyes   
 I will dry them all   
 I'm on your side   
 When times get rough   
 And friends just can't be found   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will lay me down   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will lay me down

When you're down and out   
 When you're on the street   
 When evening falls so hard   
 I will comfort you   
 I'll take your part   
 When darkness comes   
 And pain is all around   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will lay me down   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will lay me down

Sail on, silvergirl   
 Sail on by   
 Your time has come to shine   
 All your dreams are on their way   
 See how they shine   
 If you need a friend   
 I'm sailing right behind   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will ease your mind   
 Like a bridge over troubled water   
 I will ease your mind

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
