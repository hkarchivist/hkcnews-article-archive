# 我的周末歌單16-Eagles -- Hotel California Lyrics song

On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair   
 Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air   
 Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light   
 My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim   
 I had to stop for the night   
 There she stood in the doorway;   
 I heard the mission bell   
 And I was thinking to myself,   
 "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"   
 Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way   
 There were voices down the corridor,   
 I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California   
 Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)   
 Such a lovely face   
 Plenty of room at the Hotel California   
 Any time of year (Any time of year)   
 You can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends   
 She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends   
 How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.   
 Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,   
 "Please bring me my wine"   
 He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"   
 And still those voices are calling from far away,   
 Wake you up in the middle of the night   
 Just to hear them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California   
 Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)   
 Such a lovely face   
 They livin' it up at the Hotel California   
 What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)   
 Bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,   
 The pink champagne on ice   
 And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"   
 And in the master's chambers,   
 They gathered for the feast   
 They stab it with their steely knives,   
 But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was   
 Running for the door   
 I had to find the passage back   
 To the place I was before   
 "Relax, " said the night man,   
 "We are programmed to receive.   
 You can check-out any time you like,   
 But you can never leave! "

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
