# 我的周末歌單19－Don Mclean - Vincent


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210701152943if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wrNFDxCRzU" >}}


Starry, starry night   
 Paint your palette blue and gray   
 Look out on a summer's day   
 With eyes that know the darkness in my soul

Shadows on the hills   
 Sketch the trees and the daffodils   
 Catch the breeze and the winter chills   
 In colors on the snowy linen land

Now I understand   
 What you tried to say to me   
 And how you suffered for your sanity   
 And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they did not know how   
 Perhaps they'll listen now

Starry, starry night   
 Flaming flowers that brightly blaze   
 Swirling clouds in violet haze   
 Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue

Colors changing hue   
 Morning fields of amber grain   
 Weathered faces lined in pain   
 Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

For they could not love you   
 But still your love was true   
 And when no hope was left in sight   
 On that starry, starry night

You took your life, as lovers often do   
 But I could've told you Vincent   
 This world was never meant for   
 One as beautiful as you

Starry, starry night   
 Portraits hung in empty halls   
 Frame-less heads on nameless walls   
 With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

Like the strangers that you've met   
 The ragged men in ragged clothes   
 The silver thorn of bloody rose   
 Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

Now I think I know   
 What you tried to say to me   
 And how you suffered for your sanity   
 And how you tried to set them free

They would not listen, they're not listening still   
 Perhaps they never will

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
