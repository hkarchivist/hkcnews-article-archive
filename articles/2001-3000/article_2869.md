Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice   
 Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice

Listen to the sound of my voice   
 You can check it all out, it's the weapon of choice

Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice   
 It's the new weapon, weapon of choice

[2x Chorus:]   
 You can go with this,   
 Or you can go with that,   
 You can go with this,   
 Or you can go with that,   
 You can go with this,   
 Or you can go with that,   
 Or you can throw with (us) [only the 1st time]

Walk without rhythm   
 it won't attrack the worm

Walk without rhythm   
 and it won't attrack the worm

If you walk without rhythm   
 ah, you never learn

Be careful, we don't know them   
 Be careful, we don't know them   
 Be careful, we don't know them

[2x Chorus]

Organically grown, through the hemisphere I roam   
 Too big love to the angels of light   
 Yeah, and my girl

She just don't understand   
 is gone beyond being a man

As I drift off into the night, I'm in flight   
 She's a Boy scout no doubt   
 but I'm going to hold my cool,   
 because of easy rules

Yeah, so move on baby, yeah

Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah   
 Halfway between the gutter and the stars, yeah

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
