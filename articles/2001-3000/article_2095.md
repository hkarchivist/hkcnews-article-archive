I, I will be king   
 And you, you will be queen   
 Though nothing will drive them away   
 We can beat them, just for one day   
 We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean   
 And I, I'll drink all the time   
 'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact   
 Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together   
 We could steal time,   
 just for one day   
 We can be Heroes, for ever and ever   
 What d'you say?

I, I wish you could swim   
 Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim   
 Though nothing,   
 nothing will keep us together   
 We can beat them, for ever and ever   
 Oh we can be Heroes,   
 just for one day

I, I will be king   
 And you, you will be queen   
 Though nothing will drive them away   
 We can be Heroes, just for one day   
 We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)   
 Standing, by the wall (by the wall)   
 And the guns shot above our heads   
 (over our heads)   
 And we kissed,   
 as though nothing could fall   
 (nothing could fall)   
 And the shame was on the other side   
 Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever   
 Then we could be Heroes,   
 just for one day

We can be Heroes   
 We can be Heroes   
 We can be Heroes   
 Just for one day   
 We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us   
 Maybe we're lying,   
 then you better not stay   
 But we could be safer,   
 just for one day

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohh,   
 just for one day

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
