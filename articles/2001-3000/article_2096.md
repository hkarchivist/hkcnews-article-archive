# 我的周末歌單18-Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here


{{< video src="https://web.archive.org/web/20210703100231if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXdNnw99-Ic" >}}


So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.   
 Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?   
 A smile from a veil?   
 Do you think you can tell?

Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?   
 Hot ashes for trees?   
 Hot air for a cool breeze?   
 Cold comfort for change?   
 Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.   
 We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,   
 Running over the same old ground.   
 What have we found?   
 The same old fears.   
 Wish you were here.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
