I'm coming home I've done my time,   
 Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine,   
 If you receive my letter tellin' you I'd soon be free,   
 Then you'll know just what to do, if you still want me, if you still want me.   
 Tie a yellow ribbon `round the ole oak tree,   
 It's been three long years, do ya still want me?   
 If I don't see a ribbon ,round the ole oak tree,   
 I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me   
 If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree.   
 Bus driver, please look for me `cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see,   
 I'm really still in prison, and my love, she holds the key,   
 Simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free.   
 I wrote and told her please tie a yellow ribbon `round the ole oak tree,   
 It's been three long years, do ya still want me?   
 If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree,   
 I'll stay on the bus, forget about us, put the blame on me,   
 If I don't see a ribbon `round the ole oak tree.   
 Now the whole damn bus is cheering and I can't believe I see   
 A hundred yellow ribbons `round the ole oak tree.

**博客 | 仰止**

【仰止・惡質世界】我拚命張開眼睛，黑暗還是黑暗本身，這個世界本來便是一片闇黑，因為我們的祖先發明了鑽木取火，於是黑暗中就有光了。我在這裡想燃點小小星火，不期望能燎原，只想帶來螢光點點。人們都說現在是個惡質的年代，我認為無所謂惡質，找尋惡質中的優質，是我的心願。
