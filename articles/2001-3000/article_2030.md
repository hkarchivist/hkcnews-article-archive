Below is the mitigation letter written by Gabriel Leung Cheuk-wai, a former director of the Chief Executive's Office, for Donald Tsang Yam-kuen submitted at High Court.

I currently serve as Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong. Prior to my return to the University in 2012, I was Director of the Chief Executive's Office during the final year of Mr Tsang's Administration. I first came to know him in 2008 when I joined government as Under Secretary for Food and Health.

I have always held Mr Tsang in the highest regard, and not only because of his widely acknowledged achievements as a public servant, all of which have been detailed as a matter of public record, thus I do not propose to repeat here. Rather I should like to describe for you Mr Tsang as a person, and the deep humanity he personifies as I have come to appreciate, especially during the year I worked directly for and closely alongside him. It was also his 45th year in public service and probably the most difficult year throughout his entire career.

Despite the intense, sustained media assault on Mr Tsang's personal life during those final few months, which would have driven the most resilient at least to the brink of mental exhaustion, he never allowed government business to be detracted. With equanimity and characteristic discipline, he pushed ahead to ensure the timely delivery of his policy agenda and more generally his espoused manifesto five years prior. He did not once so much as raise his voice with me or any other member of the Chief Executive's Office during those most trying days; on the contrary, his unfailing courtesy to his staff and thoughtful attention, down to the littlest detail, to the well being of those around him left an indelible impression. The fact that he had done all this quietly and in private testifies to his sincerity and genuine motivations.

Not only was Mr Tsang absolutely determined to "get the job done" and done well, he did not allow his personal predicament to undermine trust in the system. At the very real risk of refocusing and prolonging attention on his past inadequacies, he set up the Independent Review Committee for the Prevention and Handling of Potential Conflicts of Interests, chaired by the former Chief Justice Hon Andrew Li. His conviction that the integrity of and confidence in the system should override any personal considerations was unshakeable.

In sum, Mr Tsang is a man made of the toughest moral fibre, while at once one with the gentlest soul and kindest heart. He may be a flawed man, as we all are for "to err is human". Given his many signal contributions during almost half a century of distinguished public service, surely it would be unjust not to take them into full account when passing judgement on him.

I trust the Court will allow for mercy in this particular instance, and I beg Your Lordship for leniency in meting out your sentence against Mr Tsang.
