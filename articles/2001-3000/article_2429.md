# Centrist change trumps business as usual

By Hongyu Wang

Once getting through the besieged primary school gate it was much calmer, even when two candidates in the upcoming closed-circle chief executive election went head to head in the forum organised by Path to Democracy. Without barely any verbal collision between former chief secretary Carrie Lam and former Court of Appeal vice-president Woo Kwok-hing, the first debate since nomination closed, where the third candidate former financial secretary John Tsang was absent, laid bare the dilemma that had been plaguing the time of our lives.

"Still learning how to be a politician", as Woo said in the early days since his surprising entry into the leadership race, seemed the natural expression throughout the retired judge's debate in the evening of March 5. Never having been a politician, Woo's rhetoric lacks a typical political cunning and condescending affectation. A precise pinpoint where his heart always leads – political reform 2.0 – linked virtually everything Woo hitherto put forward. Vowing to appoint cabinet from across the spectrum, friends and foes alike, Woo's veiled attack on Lam was only factual, that the former chief secretary's failure on political reform and the ensuing occupy movement had greatly fractured Hong Kong's social cohesion. For ever optimistic but not at all groundless, Woo, with a distinctively centrist devotion rarely seen in today's polarisation, believed in the faith of the central authority on accepting a popularly-supported and Legco-endorsed political reform 2.0 plan on which Woo stopped short of repeating his platform. On a sharp contrary, Lam's elitist "election is election but governance is governance" domineerity, self-righteousness on representing the entire 170,000 civil servants and being the saviour trusted and handpicked by Beijing did nothing more than reinforcing the executive arm's superiority and its unquestioned allegiance to everything decreed from the north.

On financial and economic front, Woo, the career barrister and common law judge, laid bare before flashlights his decency and inexperience, like a fresh breeze blowing through Hong Kong politics. Admitting his lack of insights on economic issues, Woo's response centred on the very intuition of the ordinary and decent people that small businesses ought be able to rent workplaces and hire people, some of the HK$900 billion fiscal reserves should be disbursed to cover an universal pension free of means test and overseeing financial markets will ultimately be done through respecting the independence and professionalism of regulatory bodies. Anyone watching that night must be wondering hard how someone like Lam who had worked nowhere else outside of the bureaucracy, prided her land and housing policies that had resulted in our world's least affordable city, insisted on cutting taxes for the top 1 per cent and unashamedly boasted endorsements from top capitalists like Joseph Yam, Laura Cha and Bernard Chan can ever alleviate all the economic and social hardships we the overworked and underpaid had endured for so long.

Woo is no democratic socialist. Instead centrism is fully evident in his social and welfare deliberations. Pragmatic on what is possible to achieve and with a caring mind for the working people, Woo's committee on bundling the consultation on MPF offsetting, universal pension and standard working hours manoeuvred the furthest in advancing equality in our largely relentless capitalist society. Pragmatic centrism also took centre stage in Woo's land supply proposal, when a comprehensive plan on mapping out and developing brownfield land was laid out. People-oriented Woo spared no efforts in his allocated time to appeal for a community health care network, the abolishment of primary school grade three TSA, Basic Law Article 22 legislation on safeguarding Hong Kong's autonomy and way of life and gaining rights to vet one-third of all one-way permit applications from Beijing.

Excluded from the electoral process as we the people are, lying before us are two divergent and opposing destinies. On the one, a legal professional of immense integrity and innocence and with a centrist ledge on amending all the woes and fractions has chosen to step out alone to preserve and defend all that we are; whilst on the other a technocrat mandated by the sovereign power to rule and administer regardless of the cost of who we are.

The choice lies in the very conscience of 1,194 Election Committee members and people on the streets who are embracing every adversity to ensure our children and grandchildren will grow up with the same rights and freedoms as we enjoy today. That future, a future of peace and harmony, unity and solidarity, does require our conscience today.

Five years from now when all registered voters are queuing up in polling stations to choose our next chief executive following Woo's promised one-term tenure, I believe we will recall that the choice today was our finest hour.

As Justice Woo once said on a campaign trip when his car was accidently broken, "Life is unpredictable but wonderful. Don't give up. There will be wonders waiting for you."
