# Public has spoken against ‘selective enforcement’

The Customs and Excise Department (C&ED) last week made headlines for abruptly raiding 25 AbouThai shops across the territory and seize more than 4,000 items of goods from storefronts and another 4,000 items from its Tsuen Wan warehouse. The department accused the popular “yellow” retailer, of violating the Consumer Goods Safety Regulation by not displaying safety warning labels in both Chinese and English.

C&ED however faced immediate backlash of turning a blind eye against other major retail chains, which goods without bilingual safety warning was not uncommon. It raised the question of why a “yellow” business was singled out, and whether there was political motive by the authority. People threw their back behind AbouThai by shopping there the past few days. The long queues outside the stores were highly unusual in a sluggish market hit by the epidemic. It was a telling scene that showcased the very spirit of civil disobedience, running through the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the anti-extradition-bill movement in 2019.

CitizenNews uncovered major retail chains such as Japan Home Centre, AEON, PARKnSHOP, Wellcome and Sasa, were also selling a number of products on the shelves without bilingual safety labels, putting themselves in a similar situation to AbouThai. One even placed the questionable goods in a prominent position at the storefront, which reflects how rare it was before C&ED picked on AbouThai. But not only AbouThai stores were raided, even its warehouse and over $400,000 worth of goods were confiscated.

This highly organised enforcement against was only after a relatively minor and very common problem. C&ED’s action was seen by many as a deliberate, political, and selective move by the government to crack down the “yellow economy”. Some customers queuing to even enter AbouThai told reporters that C&ED would have to similar raid against “blue” stores (seen as pro-government) like BestMart 360 to disprove the suggestion of selective law enforcement.

Before mid-2019, Hong Kong people generally believed that the disciplined forces would enforce the law fairly without political motives. However, the police did not immediately took action when white-clad mobs indiscriminately attacked passengers in Yuen Long West Rail Link station on 21 July 2019. Two officers who arrived at the scene chose to leave the crime scene. Police even allowed the culprits escape into villages in the early hours.

The public was stunned about the obvious bias and inaction by the officers. Hong Kong Connection by RTHK revealed that the police had known about the white-clad men’s gathering but did nothing about it. Bao Choy, one of the producer, was even charged by the government for making “false representation” when checking the vehicular license plate.  Former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting, who was injured for protesting fellow citizens and reported the white-clad men's crime, was also prosecuted for inciting a riot. After this series of absurd incidents that confound rights from wrongs, the public has lost confidence in impartiality of the disciplinary forces.

Precisely because of such loss of confidence, the AbouThai incident struck the wider population as a selective enforcement with political motives. In fact, there had been a number of suspected enforcement actions against “yellow” shops. They include checks on gathering restriction or restaurant hygiene regulations, and had been widely discussed on the internet. Consequently, supporters yellow shops flocked to AbouThai as a sign of protest against the government once the incident broke out.

People’s swift and massive response without centralised coordination speaks of the power of civil society. Translating into the context of an election, it will not stop voters from casting blank votes or null votes, even if the government disqualifies all the dissidents. No wonder government starts worrying about “manipulating or disrupting elections” and may amend the law to block one from encoring others to cast blank or null votes. The AbouThai incident shows that there is no need for anyone to take the lead, and people naturally know how vent their anger against the government or express their support for certain groups.

The more unreasonable the government becomes, the stronger the backlash and the stronger the “yellow economy” will be.
