# Tear gas, never rests….

**By Ginger bread**   
 ***A Hong Kong university student studying in UK***

"Your safety is our first priority.", it's not uncommon to see this sentence in emails from your management nowadays. Why? Quite a number of organizations in Hong Kong encourage staff to work from home… cops like lobbing tear gas at citizen on the streets outside, with no reason.

It's 11th November, Double Eleven Festival, a.k.a. Singles'Day in China, what do you expect to see on this beautiful Monday morning? Gift from other singles? No way! There is only one answer: Tear gas… (not to mention a citizen being critically wounded by a gunshot as wild scuffles broke out)

Funny enough, those men in blue don't realize they themselves don't wear gas mask 24-hours a day, 7-days a week; they are so use to firing tear gas bombs even though there is noone on the street, don't they know that the effect of tear gas can last for hours? Don't they know that the residue is poisonous? At the end of the day, they are poisoning themselves as well….

A not-to-be-named 70-year-old retired man, now suffers from headaches so severe he often can't sleep. He's taken antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection, yet his throat is still itchy and dry and he has a lingering cough. What has he done to deserve this? Answer: living in Hong Kong - a few months ago, this man inhaled tear gas through the closed but not airtight windows of his apartment.

Those so-called well-trained men in blue use tear gas to suppress protests every weekend and occasionally on weeknights since June.

Hong Kong is a tightly populated urban area, with the building density, tear gas often not able to escape. Don't take it cops only fire tear gas bombs in open area: don't you know it happened inside MTR (underground) stations as well? Cops just fire tear gas as they go.

Cops, keep doing this, it sparks further anger at alleged police brutality in Hong Kong…

Tear gas, never rests… cops have already gone mad….
