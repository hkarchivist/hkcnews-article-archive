# 政權傀儡越俎代庖　妄語媚共恬不知恥 ──大專學界就八大高層發表聯合公告之聲明

日前，八所大專院校之高層發表聯合公告，強調大專院校非解決政治議題之地，更不應有任何政治立場，其所提供的支援及協助亦僅出於關顧之情。大專學界必須強調，大專院校匯聚知識份子於一堂，決不能只作漠視社會現況之象牙塔。在白色恐怖日益猖獗的時代中，大專院校更是言論自由之最後堡壘，予同學及社會人仕就社會議題交換意見、暢所欲言，引領社會思潮。大專學界在此強烈譴責眾高層之失責言論，促請其恪守大學之辦學宗旨。

各高層表示會依程序處理違法或違反校規的學生或教職員，如解除學籍或解僱相關人仕。大專學界就此表示震怒。過去四個月，政權強行施以制度暴力，無數香港人為捍衛我城之核心價值負隅奮戰。血色夏天之中，面對警黑濫暴，義士為守護香港人民主、自由、法治、公義而犧牲，有或頭破血流，有或身陷囹圄，當中受害者不乏各院校師生。正如浸會大學錢大康校長曾指出，給予青年人希望乃大學無可推卸之責。各大專院校身處高位者於艱難時期，更應嘗試理解年青人走上街頭抗爭背後之理念，站在學子一邊，向他們伸出援手；而非為虎作倀，對制度暴力、警黑暴力視而不見，只空談所謂法規，以嚴刑峻法將年青人推向絕望深淵。

再者，各院校之校董會或校委會主席均由林鄭月娥委任，以院校高層之名，充當政權傀儡為實，決策或非以大專院校之利益為前提，如今更搬弄名銜以逢迎政權，越俎代庖，對校園事務說三道四。大專學界在此強烈要求，一眾校董會或校委會主席應安份守己，明白自身並無資格如此干涉校政。

大專院校本應促進思想及交流，令學生窮究事物原理，為社會帶來衝擊，而學術自由更為大專院校之核心價值，成員之表達自由並不應被限制。作為大專院校之高層，理應營造理想環境，恪守以上價值，其卻背其道而行之，公然挑戰學術自由。此等劣行更顯大專院校已成港共政權之爪牙，在拒絕學生於大專院校談論政治議題的同時，肆意散播白色恐怖，更企圖進行政治打壓，如阻撓科大民選學生校董就任，實在自相予盾。大專學界在此重申，大專院校必須捍衛學術自由，並使其成員享有免於恐懼的自由。

大專學界對此聯合公告表示極度憤慨，在此要求高層莫再作港共政權傀儡，一切言行必須以大專院校及其學生利益為依歸，與學生共渡風雨飄搖之時，履行己責。

### Statement from Students' Unions of Higher Institutions in Response to the Joint Statement Issued by Heads of Eight University Governing Councils

Students’ Unions of tertiary institutions strongly condemn the irresponsible statement made by heads of eight university governing councils and urge them to respect the roles of Tertiary Institutions. Student Unions of Tertiary Institutions would like to remind all that Tertiary Institutions are platforms for idea exchange and free discussion, places for cultivating ideas that will inspire and lead our society in our way forward. In these times of turmoil when white terror rages, Tertiary Institutions must be the strongholds for freedom of speech.

Heads of university governing councils stated that they will terminate students and staff who violate the law or the school's code of conduct by defined procedures. In the past four months, Hongkongers have been fighting for the core values of our city in the face of violent oppression by the totalitarian regime. Numerous protesters have sacrificed a lot for protecting our freedom and democracy. Some were arrested and prosecuted, while some were severely injured by the outrageous violence by the Hong Kong Police Force; among these brave citizens, many of them are students and staff of the Tertiary Institutions. In such difficult times, leaders of the Institutions should stand with the students and try to understand the reasons behind their actions, providing them with the support they need. They shall in no way stand with the tyrannical regime in oppressing the citizens, conniving at the brutality of Hong Kong Police Force and totalitarian rule of the regime. To punish students and staff in the name of order and stability will only further push the youngsters of our city into absolute despair.

Furthermore, heads of University governing councils are all nothing but marionettes appointed by Carrie Lam. These puppets never prioritise the interests of the Tertiary Institutions when they act and make decisions. It is ridiculous for them to comment on and interfere with university affairs in such intrusive manners, just for pleasing the totalitarian regime. The Students’ Unions demand them to stop their uninvited and unwelcome involvement in university affairs.   
   
 With academic freedom being one of the core values of Tertiary Institutions, freedom of expression should never be hindered. The initial objectives of Tertiary Institutions are to facilitate thinking and communication, to lead students to pursue knowledge and make a significant impact on society. It is the responsibility of heads of Tertiary Institutions to sculpt an ideal environment for students and adhere to the crucial values. Instead, they act in contravention and publicly challenged academic freedom. These inferior acts further prove the interference of the Hong Kong regime on Tertiary Institutions, impeding students to discuss political affairs, disseminating white terror among students, attempting to suppress political dissidents such as interrupting the democratically elected student to take office in the HKUST Council. Student Unions hereby reiterate that Tertiary Institutions must defend academic freedom and assure the members of institutions can enjoy the freedom from fear.

Student Unions of Tertiary Institutions hereby express our indignation at the joint statement. We demand the heads of University governing councils to stop being marionettes of the communist regime, prioritize the well-being and interests of institutions and students and fulfil their responsibility to stand alongside students in these times of turmoil.
