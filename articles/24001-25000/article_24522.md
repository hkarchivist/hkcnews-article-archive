# Hell of the Orient (once Pearl of the Orient)

**By Ginger bread**   
 ***A Hong Kong university student studying in UK***

Is Hong Kong safe? NO! The situation is worsening and things could get worse.

A boy was gunshot at point-blank range, a little girl was arrested – weeping & shivering, a First-Aid volunteer's arm being brutally broken deliberately, heads of citizens being bashed barbarously with police batons, necks of people being fractured by full body weight, detained protestors being tortured, protestors disappeared with no clue – probably dead? not to mention indiscriminate beating….. who did (is still doing) all these? Hong Kong Police Force.

You wanna lodge a complaint against the men in blue? You must be kidding…. They hide their warrant cards & UI with the government's endorsement; you wanna ask them to verify their identity? Dream on……

Hong Kong Police Force… bet most of them have the hallucination that they are playing real-life Nintendo war-game, the more Hong Kong citizen they hurt/kill, they happier they are. Google it, it's not uncommon to see cops smiling while shooting/spraying pepper spray against citizen.

Unbelievable… HKSAR government supports all these sins….

Having said all of the above, if you fancy a free-of-charge tear gas smorgasbord, blue dye water canons, a brutal violence by immature cops, or non-sense yelling with no reason, feel free to drop by, afterall, doubt you can experience such in a developed city.

Can you hear the people sing?
