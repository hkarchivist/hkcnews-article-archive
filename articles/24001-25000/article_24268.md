# Four Good Months, and Evermore

**By the Hong Kong Nation**

Miss Ng of CUHK was right that she was scared and did not know what would happen. Me neither. I tend to believe extra-judicial killings on 8.31 night. From her account she must have been one of those been transported to Lai Chi Kok station from a sealed slaughterhouse of Prince Edward station in the small hours of 9.1. I was two stations away when train suddenly stopped in tunnel in between stations. Some half hour later it backed to one of few stations just about to close. It could have been me; it could have been any of us. But the great revolution of our times had long started and there is only one way forward - flight on till victory.

I did not make it to Edward's appeal hearing on the day that marked the fourth month of this rebellion, but I did broadcast live by word the previous night at West Kowloon magistracy when twenty-six righteous were charged with rioting and brought to court for yet another battle of 10.6. Another battle. Yes. I had long lost count.

I was at Castle Peak road Yuen Long section the other day when out of blue I brust in tears on a light rail station. I remembered that was the exact battleground on 7.27, when in retribution of the terrorist attack the previous Sunday hundreds of thousands marched the first time without an no objection notice, which nobody expects any now.

I keep wondering: in another century how will people remember this great revolt? When we are old enough to face imminent death will we be able to go back to all those sacred grounds - hand in hand with our children and grandchildren and tell them that decades ago when the Hong Kong nation was in its extinction these were the very places that saw her revival, blossoming and victory. That answer gives meaning to our fight today, which in turn gives meaning to our lives.

Edward once said, "whenever tyranny is a fact, revolution becomes a duty". In this fatalistic time of great struggle, I share his optimism. I would not even believe myself if I say that I have always been a genuine frontliner all along everytime since the very first outbreak of 6.12 when in a last cry hundreds of thousands of citizens besieged legco, a day when fights broke out in early afternoon and had since then burning bright and brighter still. But I did give my all to the Hong Kong nation. And each and every time after moments of mental struggle I always come back to the same answer.

I remember on the last day of June there was a memorial service beneath legco building to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of an education university student - looking back to be the second martyr. It was said that tomorrow might be the last chance, the last strike. Nobody would expect the revolution of our times to survive beyond 7.1. But here we are - four good months, and evermore!
