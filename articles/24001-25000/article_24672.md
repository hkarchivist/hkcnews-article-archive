How do party animals in Hong Kong celebrate Halloween? From blood splattered zombie walks to spooky street parades, scream park's and pet parties. Well, no matter where do Hong Kong people celebrate Halloween, Lan Kwai Fong is for sure the most crowded area on Halloween. Bars and entertainment venues there are usually packed on Halloween, with costumed revelers spilling out into the district's narrow streets, where people drink in the open.

Hmm…. Not this Halloween though….

So, no party, no celebration, what’s there? Police sealed the area off at its main entrance, fired continuous tear gas bomb, struck citizens with batons, sprayed pepper sprays in people's eyes, beat people brutally – without one single reason.

Goodness, this Halloween, bet the Hong Kong Police Force was the ONLY living thing on earth whom had a good time – who in the world can have the pleasure of torturing people with all the support from the Government?

Allan Zeman, chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, said many businesses had suffered a drop of about 50 per cent - compared with Halloween last year, while some had lost as much as 70 per cent or higher.

"It was just a crazy, crazy night. That was the first time. We've never had something like this." said Allan. "It was the worst shock to business the area had experienced since the outbreak of Severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003."

Thought you could walk along the street in your Halloween costume? Ha! Police would force you to kneel down with both hands in the air – sounds familiar? Bingo! German Narcissist!

People, no more "Trick or Treat?", it's now "Knee or Feet?"..….
