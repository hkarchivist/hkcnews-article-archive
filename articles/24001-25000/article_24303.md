# 【聯署聲明】多個傳媒工會及組織嚴正反對一切篩選記者措施

近日有報道指，政府和警方研究以官方發證、派發官方認可的識別物品等方式，辨識在示威衝突現場採訪的記者，香港記者協會、香港攝影記者協會等傳媒工會及組織發表聯合聲明，嚴正反對一切官方篩選記者的措施，認為無可避免會損害新聞自由和公眾知情權。

雖然行政長官林鄭月娥已經明確否認，無意官方統一發放記者證，但未有談及以其他方式識別記者的可能性，各工會及組織認為空穴來風，有必要表明立場，傳媒作為監察政府和公權力運用的第四權，若容許官方認證和篩選在公眾地方採訪的記者，毫無疑問將收窄自由採訪空間，不利資訊傳達和發掘真相。

事實上，在近日的公眾活動以至警民衝突中，在場採訪的記者一直配合警方執法行動，警方亦一直可以服飾、裝備、行為以及佩戴的記者證，辨識在場採訪的記者，任何官方認證篩選在公眾地方採訪記者的機制都是多此一舉，更值得憂慮是一旦引入任何類似機制，將極易被濫用成截查、驅逐記者的工具，而且官方認證的條件可以隨意改動，拒絕配合官方做法或未獲官方接納的記者，在進行採訪時，將面臨極大威脅和風險。

### Joint statement by journalist unions, groups and academics against any selection of journalists arrangements

Recent press reports said the Government and the Police are conducting studies on the issuing of official press cards and identification items and other methods for the purpose of identifying reporters covering protests. Journalist unions, groups and academics solemnly opposes any official selection of journalists arrangements, which will inevitably undermine press freedom and the public’s right to know.

Chief Executive Carrie Lam has denied that the government has intention of issuing official press cards. But she has not touched upon the possibility of issuing other forms of press identification. We believe speculation about official press identification arrangement is not groundless. To state our clean position is a must. Media plays the role of fourth power in the society, monitoring the exercise of power by the Government. Any arrangements that allow the Government to select journalists through official identification in reporting in public places will no doubt limit the room of freedom of reporting. That will not be conducive to free flow of information and truth-finding.

The fact is that reporters have been coordinating with the Police in their law-enforcement in the recent protests and conflicts between the Police and protesters. Police officers have been able to identify journalists from their dress, equipment, activities and press cards. Any arrangement of official identification items for the selection of journalists reporting in public places is unnecessary. More worryingly, such arrangements could be easily abused and turned into a tool for police officers to conduct stop-and-search and drive away reporters.

Furthermore, the requirements for the application of official identification can be arbitrarily changed. Those who refuse to accept the official identification or whose application fails will face more threats and risks in their reporting activities.
