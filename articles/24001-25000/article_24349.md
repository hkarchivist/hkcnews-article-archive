# A plead from Hong Kongers: Can we tell the world we have a government that turns a blind eye to domestic violence against its civilians while caring so much about the international opinions?

Will the international community know that it is extremely rare to have a chance to see our Chief Executive and our Police Chief appear publicly these days even though we have suffered a great deal over the past four months, shedding tons of tears and blood?

This morning, Hong Kongers felt dumbfounded seeing Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the police chief Lo Wai-chung who spared no time to apologise to the Muslim community after the police's water cannon truck sprayed toxic blue dye at the city's biggest Mosque. Though the government tried to see it as an accident, the attack, as can be seen in different versions of videos, is just a vivid demonstration of the police's currently by-default indiscriminate and violent attacking mode against its citizens in each of its operations.

We haven't seen the chiefs of the Government or of the Police coming out once to show their concern, not to mention apology, for any civilian casualties inflicted by the police. We couldn't hear from them, or see them, after countless severe or even life-threatening injuries caused by the police's unrestrained and unjustified attacks.

We didn't find them say a word of comfort or apology about the police's judgement for a 17 years old student having gun shot right to his chest; for frontline helpers including a female first-aid volunteer and a female Indonesian journalist having one of their eyes smashed bloodily by the bean bag bullet attacks; for residents from a great number of communities and facilities, including senior homes, suffering gravely after inhaling expired and toxic tear gas, just to name a few.

Carrie Lam and her whole cabinet are notorious for hiding themselves from their "turtle shells" for months. Her and her bureau chiefs' silence implies their permission for the brutality against the protestors and ordinary citizens.  She remains absent when we can see incidents causing serious bodily harm to Hong Kong people because of the evidently restless behaviours of the police officers. She remains silent and keeps giving full support to the police force even when the number of casualties and "suspicious" suicide cases having escalated to more than 2000 and more than a hundred respectively over the past four mouths.

Her refusal to respond to the demands of the four-month long protest has brought new heights and momentum to the movement week after week. The protest, which Hong Kongers keep fighting for, basically calls for restoring the Hong Kong's spirit, namely respect for the rule of law and human rights including freedom of speech, the very basic values that are shared by the international community.

The irresponsible attitude of the whole cabinet are strikingly unacceptable to any government with a democratic and accountable system. Sadly this expectation cannot be applied to the current Hong Kong SAR government, which is in reality the puppet figure of the Beijing Government. This is regardless of the fact that each of these bureau chiefs in the Hong Kong government earns HK$4 to 5 millions annually.

The hands off approach can be an evident of the government's tactic, which encouraged police's brutality against Hong Kong citizens as it is the only means to put the months-long protest under control. When Beijing, at the very beginning, decided to identify the protest as a terrorist movement, sound justifications have been given to the police force to use unlimited power and mighty weapons including water cannon trucks to exercise random and brutal attacks as its persecution against ordinary people who may or may not have participated in protests. Police officers also have green light to put aside the long-held and respectful police's rules and regulations to exercise discretions without consequences, especially when they can cover their identity numbers and even wear face masks during operations.

Police's excessive use of force against Hong Kong citizens has been so prevalent that the photo and video images capturing their brutality are suffice for a photo exhibition and roadshow open to the public.

May Hong Kongers use this disrespectful attack against the Muslim Mosque to plead for attention of the international community to the reality that Hong Kong people are living in a police state? We experience daily the blatant violations of our human rights by the Hong Kong police and the government who will not bother to give us even one apology.
