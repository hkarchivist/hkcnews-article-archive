# Any room for compromise?

**By Gingerbread**   
 ***A Hong Kong university student studying in UK***

In Down Under, bushfires burning across NSW, hail storms smash part of Queensland; in Canada, significant snowfall hits Toronto; in Austria, snow & floods destroy homes in Venice. What about our beloved Hong Kong?

Hong Kong is a blessed place, well, at least, natural disaster doesn't visit Hong Kong as often as. Why don't cops precious this blessing? Why do they keep firing tear gas to grey the sky? Why do they keep polluting the environment with blue dye from water cannon? Why do they keep torturing & hurting citizens?

Polytechnic University is now a war zone – a real-life war zone. Activists got boxed in by cops, many of them attempted to leave the besieged campus but failed. Yup, failed….. huh??? Thought those brutal cops wanted to kick them out of the campus? Nope, wrong, absolutely WRONG!!! Cops requested activists to leave the campus via Core Y, activists followed what they said, but guess what? Activists got arrested as soon as they reached Core Y…. Do you still have trust in the Hong Kong Police Force?

What about fleeing via other channels? Cops fired teargas & rubber bullets (well, let's assume they are rubber bullets, not real bullets) at exits, purpose? To prevent activists from leaving. Cool! What's next? Fire further rounds of teargas, engulfing the campus in smoke. Glad to hear that dozens inside the campus have abseiled onto highway & escaped – hope you guys are safe.

What else did cops do? Ruthless ones arrested doctors & nurses, minimized any First AID assistance; barbarous ones kept bashing people's head neglecting blood bursting out; heartless ones dragged arrested people all the way on roads with broken bricks; inhuman ones banged arrested people's head against the wall; and lots & lots insane uncivilized evil offenses – Ooops, they're law enforcement bodies, they can do whatever they like, no such word as "offense" in their dictionaries.

What a tragedy…. Is peace feasible? Any room for compromise?
