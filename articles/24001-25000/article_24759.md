# Ｖ

By

I don’t have any happy and pretty pictures to post today. Hong Kong is on edge and I saw and felt it first hand this morning.

I am still in a bit of shock from my commute to work this morning.   
 All was going well until I was sitting on the bench waiting for my train in Nam Cheong. There were a few protesters with masks on milling about in the station, but I didn’t feel too uncomfortable.   
 This kid (20-something) came and put his bag on the bench near me and told me I needed to ‘get out of here now’, it was soon to become a ‘war zone’. I looked around a bit more closely and there were people clearly on point. He started getting his gear on. Full on - pads, helmet, mask, and respirator type thingy. I suddenly felt quite emotional and got really teary and told him to be careful and stay safe. He was younger than both my kids. He stopped, looked up at me and said thank you. He said to me, we have to do this. You understand we have to do this. Through my crying, I said his parents must be really worried about him. He pointed to a man standing on the platform and told me it was his dad. He was in regular clothes and on his phone, discreetly walking and directing people under his breath. Suddenly two more protestors ran up to the kid I was talking to. They spoke in rapid Cantonese. I heard popo. (police) Suddenly the train was approaching and he led me to the platform by my arm and said I must get on the train - now. From the other side of the station the MTR staff were suddenly shouting and the riot police (in full gear) we storming the platform area from the escalator. The train doors opened and he firmly pushed me onto the train and then he ran off in the other direction. It was all so surreal. I just kept hoping they wouldn’t come on the train. The train doors closed. Then they opened. Then closed and opened again. They made us all get off the train, back onto the platform. We get out. No police, no protestors in sight but I could hear the commotion happening elsewhere. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t feel safe staying there so I got on the next train but felt really vulnerable being stuck in the stations. So, I went a couple of stops, called Ian, and got out at Hung Hom.   
 I got out of the station and went directly to the taxi stand. There were about 50 people in line. No taxis. Tried getting an Uber but there were none. But, it felt safe and calm. For about 10 minutes. Then more protestors came running from the other side of the station, followed by more riot police. So surreal. Finally got confirmation of an Uber available to pick me up in 10 minutes. People were clearly beginning to be on edge and people started leaving the taxi queue. There were no taxis coming. My Uber came. I got in and just started to cry. We drove. I saw fires in the middle of roads and on sidewalks. Bricks, stones, shit everywhere. Protester pockets here and there. Police surrounding anyone and everyone and I assume they were asking for ID’s. Two kids were shoved up against a wall, face first. Yes, they were in black and had masks on.   
 Fire trucks coming and going everywhere, caged police vans everywhere sirens blaring. More protestors smashing traffic lights. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was going to take photos but the driver told me to put my phone away and keep my head down. So I did.   
 I saw as we drove, the city I love so much filled with angst and pain. It was all very overwhelming.

I realized this morning that I have led a very sheltered and protected life.
